				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I wanted to live a Year of Enough. Now, I live in a pandemic epicenter where there is no more. Ironic, don‚Äôt you think? Inside all the uncertainty, I‚Äôm discovering the seeds of enough.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It is 9:10 am Eastern Standard Time here in my  study. I&rsquo;m typing on my macbook pro with the sticky left shift key, while reclining in my overstuffed, brown, worn, leather chair. The view out of my window is full of blue morning March sky, still-bare trees and patchy spring grass. My fuzzy sherpa lap blanket will soon make me feel too warm.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Birds and frogs are chirping, the quiet of February steadily filling with noisy arrivals, like spring breakers. I can&rsquo;t hear them through my headphones, my Focus@Will timer playing ambient music for 40 minutes. When the timer goes off, I will iron my wrinkled shirt and curl my wrinkled hair before my 10:00 am video meeting.</p>\n<p>I feel sad and scared. Do you? The coronavirus has gone from far away news snippets to a clear and present danger. I&rsquo;m tired of the word &ldquo;coronavirus&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m exhausted by the headlines. I am writing this to you because the only thing that has felt good and right lately is how people are talking more honestly, sincerely, and openly now. I work in technology, where feelings and authentic talk is usually verbotten. Even my twitter exchanges have been more meaningful. We are making ourselves visible inside our disconnected, disconcerting new normal.</p>\n<p>So here I am, just talking and hoping that helps.</p>\n<p>My husband, two dogs, two cats, two rats and ferret are weathering the storm here in the Hudson Valley, 90 minutes north of NYC. Next week, we&rsquo;ll add six chicks to our household. We have plenty of food in the fridge, having ventured out to Adams Fairacre Farms a few days ago. We didn&rsquo;t need to stock up on much though. Twoish years ago, when layoffs were pre-announced at the company we both worked for, we built wooden shelves in the basement and stocked up on items we use regularly. Our financial situation stabilized by the middle of last year, so we bought things when we ran out rather than bring them up from the basement. Thus is why we have plenty of toilet paper.</p>\n<p>Side note: Has no one ever gone backpacking? In an emergency, is toilet paper the life saving item one wants on hand?</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say about what is happening in the world. Does anyone really? Nothing I&rsquo;ve said, adding to the giant flood of information spewing from everywhere, has felt meaningful, valuable, matterful. It&rsquo;s tough, isn&rsquo;t it, to know how to feel? I&rsquo;m angry right now and I have no idea why. I can suddenly be consumed by it. I&rsquo;ve also been unbearably sad, each news item full of so much heartbreak and loss. Yesterday the news was Powells bookstore, which is a church, a shrine, holy ground. The store has closed and everyone is laid off and who knows what will happen. Powell&rsquo;s is a metaphor for so much isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>Who know what will happen?</p>\n<p>I am not a fan of uncertainty. Is anyone? Ironically, uncertainty is my profession. I architect technology decisions, the best possible solution under the circumstances, when the circumstances and outcomes are uncertain. Circumstances and outcomes are <em>always</em> uncertain, I say. We never really know. We must make our best choices anyway. I give talks about strengthening our ability to act without needing to make everything &lsquo;concrete&rsquo; first. Instead, I say, establish good patterns and trust they will flourish into good, if unexpected, systems that nourish us.</p>\n<p>Yet, here I am, drowning in uncertainty. I&rsquo;m in the water with everyone else, our ship sinking. I hope we can swim. I hope sharks aren&rsquo;t nearby. I hope we aren&rsquo;t in the water too long.</p>\n<p>That metaphor, drowning, feels apt 23.5 hours a day. During the other 30 minutes though, I feel free. As if the ship was a slave ship powered by meaningless human consumption. Products replacing food. Amazon wharehouses replacing local stores. iPhones replacing books. I had a feeling yesterday of being &ldquo;nearly done&rdquo; with stuff I had to do. I haven&rsquo;t had that feeling <em>in years</em>.</p>\n<p>We rely on systems that, frankly, don&rsquo;t give a fuck about our well being. Or the planet&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ve been cruising on ships constantly seeking &ldquo;new worlds&rdquo; and &ldquo;more stuff&rdquo; while missing all the boats going to safer harbors like loving kindness, self worth, joy, enough, nourishment, satisfaction, contentment and renewal.</p>\n<p>The mornings are my safe harbor. Yesterday, I got up at 3am. Today, I slept until 5:30 then went downstairs to make coffee in a French Press because our Bialeti isn&rsquo;t working right, despite my replacing the seal. I warm Silk soy creamer in our spinny creamer warmer. While the coffee brews, I put the dryer on dewrinkle, fluffing the duvet covers that have lingered in there for three days. I open the fridge and pull out bits of cheese, kale and homemade almond crackers for my pet rats. I add  MCT oil to my coffee cup because I need brain food.</p>\n<p>All the while, through my usual routine, there is a persistent, nebulous anger. Thoughts rushing in my brain about past betrayals and abandonments. My irritated mind feeding my body the message that something is very wrong. Even though I&rsquo;m simply making coffee.</p>\n<p>I take my cup, as I always do, upstairs into my study and write in my journal for an hour. I write with favorite fountain pen, the one Neil Gamain recommended. I write at the top of the page, as I always do, the date, time, moon cycle, number of days left in various countdowns and the selected daily tarot card.</p>\n<p>Today&rsquo;s was Reversed Emperor. Which can symbolize the abuse of power and authority. Or the end of overreaching, over presumptive male authority. I&rsquo;ll just leave that thought right here.</p>\n<p>In my journal, I make lists, use writing prompts, create space for my strategic, intuitive and &ldquo;wiser&rdquo; mind to discuss options with my &ldquo;wordly&rdquo; self. I am meditating, in my way. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know if I could maintain any reasonable quality of life if I stopped journaling. That sounds dire and overly dramatic, so I want to delete it. But it&rsquo;s not entirely untrue, so it stays.</p>\n<p>Today I wrote about the changes in the world: what seeds are being planted, what is sprouting, where are the tender but stable shoots, what is blooming, fading, compost? My answers were all about how we seek, share, consume and exchange information. My income relies on building the systems that exchange information, so this perhaps a bit self serving. But, I suspect, it is at least somewhat accurate.</p>\n<p>I also wrote a letter from Goddess to myself, wondering what I would hear if I could hear a wiser voice than my own. She said (paraphrasing) that it&rsquo;s time to take full responsibility for living a deeply authentic life. She said &ldquo;this is life and death situation, not simply because we are living in viral times, but because we must choose.&rdquo; Choose to come home to ourselves, to what matters. We can take that journey together. We can look to ourselves more and the world less for happiness.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is only what I need to hear. I don&rsquo;t believe in a divine authority outside of my own consciousness. This is me talking to me, in a sense. I don&rsquo;t believe that my daily tarot card is external to me either. I <em>do</em> believe that inuition is essential to crafting a worldview that is wiser than than simply asking myself what I <em>think</em>.

				"content_text": "<!--excerpt-->\nI wanted to live a Year of Enough. Now, I live in a pandemic epicenter where there is no more. Ironic, don‚Äôt you think? Inside all the uncertainty, I‚Äôm discovering the seeds of enough.\n<!--more-->\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.montalion.com/uploads/2024/rainbow.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"449\" alt=\"\">\n\nIt is 9:10 am Eastern Standard Time here in my  study. I'm typing on my macbook pro with the sticky left shift key, while reclining in my overstuffed, brown, worn, leather chair. The view out of my window is full of blue morning March sky, still-bare trees and patchy spring grass. My fuzzy sherpa lap blanket will soon make me feel too warm.<!--more-->\n\nBirds and frogs are chirping, the quiet of February steadily filling with noisy arrivals, like spring breakers. I can't hear them through my headphones, my Focus@Will timer playing ambient music for 40 minutes. When the timer goes off, I will iron my wrinkled shirt and curl my wrinkled hair before my 10:00 am video meeting.\n\nI feel sad and scared. Do you? The coronavirus has gone from far away news snippets to a clear and present danger. I'm tired of the word \"coronavirus\". I'm exhausted by the headlines. I am writing this to you because the only thing that has felt good and right lately is how people are talking more honestly, sincerely, and openly now. I work in technology, where feelings and authentic talk is usually verbotten. Even my twitter exchanges have been more meaningful. We are making ourselves visible inside our disconnected, disconcerting new normal.\n\nSo here I am, just talking and hoping that helps.\n\nMy husband, two dogs, two cats, two rats and ferret are weathering the storm here in the Hudson Valley, 90 minutes north of NYC. Next week, we'll add six chicks to our household. We have plenty of food in the fridge, having ventured out to Adams Fairacre Farms a few days ago. We didn't need to stock up on much though. Twoish years ago, when layoffs were pre-announced at the company we both worked for, we built wooden shelves in the basement and stocked up on items we use regularly. Our financial situation stabilized by the middle of last year, so we bought things when we ran out rather than bring them up from the basement. Thus is why we have plenty of toilet paper.\n\nSide note: Has no one ever gone backpacking? In an emergency, is toilet paper the life saving item one wants on hand?\n\nI don't know what to say about what is happening in the world. Does anyone really? Nothing I've said, adding to the giant flood of information spewing from everywhere, has felt meaningful, valuable, matterful. It's tough, isn't it, to know how to feel? I'm angry right now and I have no idea why. I can suddenly be consumed by it. I've also been unbearably sad, each news item full of so much heartbreak and loss. Yesterday the news was Powells bookstore, which is a church, a shrine, holy ground. The store has closed and everyone is laid off and who knows what will happen. Powell's is a metaphor for so much isn't it?\n\nWho know what will happen?\n\nI am not a fan of uncertainty. Is anyone? Ironically, uncertainty is my profession. I architect technology decisions, the best possible solution under the circumstances, when the circumstances and outcomes are uncertain. Circumstances and outcomes are *always* uncertain, I say. We never really know. We must make our best choices anyway. I give talks about strengthening our ability to act without needing to make everything 'concrete' first. Instead, I say, establish good patterns and trust they will flourish into good, if unexpected, systems that nourish us.\n\nYet, here I am, drowning in uncertainty. I'm in the water with everyone else, our ship sinking. I hope we can swim. I hope sharks aren't nearby. I hope we aren't in the water too long.\n\nThat metaphor, drowning, feels apt 23.5 hours a day. During the other 30 minutes though, I feel free. As if the ship was a slave ship powered by meaningless human consumption. Products replacing food. Amazon wharehouses replacing local stores. iPhones replacing books. I had a feeling yesterday of being \"nearly done\" with stuff I had to do. I haven't had that feeling *in years*.\n\nWe rely on systems that, frankly, don't give a fuck about our well being. Or the planet's. We've been cruising on ships constantly seeking \"new worlds\" and \"more stuff\" while missing all the boats going to safer harbors like loving kindness, self worth, joy, enough, nourishment, satisfaction, contentment and renewal.\n\nThe mornings are my safe harbor. Yesterday, I got up at 3am. Today, I slept until 5:30 then went downstairs to make coffee in a French Press because our Bialeti isn't working right, despite my replacing the seal. I warm Silk soy creamer in our spinny creamer warmer. While the coffee brews, I put the dryer on dewrinkle, fluffing the duvet covers that have lingered in there for three days. I open the fridge and pull out bits of cheese, kale and homemade almond crackers for my pet rats. I add  MCT oil to my coffee cup because I need brain food.\n\nAll the while, through my usual routine, there is a persistent, nebulous anger. Thoughts rushing in my brain about past betrayals and abandonments. My irritated mind feeding my body the message that something is very wrong. Even though I'm simply making coffee.\n\nI take my cup, as I always do, upstairs into my study and write in my journal for an hour. I write with favorite fountain pen, the one Neil Gamain recommended. I write at the top of the page, as I always do, the date, time, moon cycle, number of days left in various countdowns and the selected daily tarot card.\n\nToday's was Reversed Emperor. Which can symbolize the abuse of power and authority. Or the end of overreaching, over presumptive male authority. I'll just leave that thought right here.\n\nIn my journal, I make lists, use writing prompts, create space for my strategic, intuitive and \"wiser\" mind to discuss options with my \"wordly\" self. I am meditating, in my way. To be honest, I don't know if I could maintain any reasonable quality of life if I stopped journaling. That sounds dire and overly dramatic, so I want to delete it. But it's not entirely untrue, so it stays.\n\nToday I wrote about the changes in the world: what seeds are being planted, what is sprouting, where are the tender but stable shoots, what is blooming, fading, compost? My answers were all about how we seek, share, consume and exchange information. My income relies on building the systems that exchange information, so this perhaps a bit self serving. But, I suspect, it is at least somewhat accurate.\n\nI also wrote a letter from Goddess to myself, wondering what I would hear if I could hear a wiser voice than my own. She said (paraphrasing) that it's time to take full responsibility for living a deeply authentic life. She said \"this is life and death situation, not simply because we are living in viral times, but because we must choose.\" Choose to come home to ourselves, to what matters. We can take that journey together. We can look to ourselves more and the world less for happiness.\n\nPerhaps this is only what I need to hear. I don't believe in a divine authority outside of my own consciousness. This is me talking to me, in a sense. I don't believe that my daily tarot card is external to me either. I *do* believe that inuition is essential to crafting a worldview that is wiser than than simply asking myself what I *think*. Or feel.\n\nRegardless, perhaps this is good for you to hear too. That we do have some ability to steer our ship. We have no choice but to hunker down. We can choose to take stock of what we value most. And to build a world that resembles that value.\n\nWe can choose to discover what is (truly) enough.\n",

He wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;having trouble in math&rdquo;. He was having trouble in school.</p>\n<p>I tried to find support for our situation but there wasn&rsquo;t much. He was always working at multilevels, sometimes grade school work was right, other times, college texts. No school I found, public or private, was set up for that. So, I made things up as I went along. Other mothers on the journey supported me and those who&rsquo;d walked the road before.</p>\n<p>I taught but I also studied with him. I went back to school myself, after taking him to his physics class and enjoying it, which began a STEM career in technology that I never would have imagined prior. But that&rsquo;s a story for another day.</p>\n<p>What I learned during that decade, first and foremost, is that there is no one right way to educate anyone. Every kid, every person, is different. I have many thoughts about this subject, many of which are different from my thinking the day the call came. But here, in the midst of coronavirus, I want to focus on <em>strategies for working while also educating at home</em>.</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary. Because [see above sentence about &ldquo;no one right way&rdquo;].</p>\n<p>Here are the seven things I learned the hard way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Face it, right now. Early morning is the only time you can focus.</li>\n<li>Do &ldquo;in seat&rdquo; work together in the same room</li>\n<li>Become initiative driven rather than task driven</li>\n<li>When it looks like nothing is happening , more is happening</li>\n<li>Floppy fish is essential, don&rsquo;t interrupt it</li>\n<li>Ask them to teach you how to do something</li>\n<li>Stop early. (If you want to stay sane)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"get-up-stupid-early\">Get up stupid early</h2>\n<p>As soon as my son stopped taking naps (long before kindergarten), my focused work day fell apart. Oh, I hated that transition. I was at my writing desk the day the call came. I should have heard the giant crack in my creative foundation.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I tried everything to write or study while he was awake. I failed. Only two things worked: doing focused work before he woke up or when he was elsewhere (like at a friend&rsquo;s house.)</p>\n<p>Now, I am a morning person. And he is not. So that helped. But it meant that I was ready for bed by 8pm and he was not. So we had a rule, once he was old enough: you have to go to bed when I do. You do not have to sleep. You can read or (later) play gameboy. Color. Bring legos. But you must stay quiet in bed and you can&rsquo;t use the internet. This got us by until he was old enough to manage his own evenings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work-together\">Work together</h2>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t focus on my tasks when a part of my mind is monitoring whether or not someone else is doing their tasks somewhere else. It&rsquo;s maddening. Leaving the room was never a great strategy, his daydreaming approach to studying persisted. Plus, tasks are lonely, aren&rsquo;t they? Doing &ldquo;seat work&rdquo; is better together.</p>\n<p>We often did our &ldquo;homework&rdquo; at the same table. I don&rsquo;t mean I helped him with his, though I would. I mean we both showed up with work to do. I think this developed better relational habits. Habits that translated to restaurants, airplanes &hellip; I&rsquo;ve even taught a yoga class with him nearby.</p>\n<p>In fairness, he&rsquo;s inclined towards self entertainment and was more interested in his matchbox cars than being rowdy in public. So I got that for free. But even without that &hellip; modeling the behavoir you are looking for is, in my experience, far more effective than demanding it.</p>\n<p>Side note: this also applies to reading together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-projects\">Create projects</h2>\n<p>One thing I truly hate about traditional &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; is how it can suck all the joy out of things. Joy arises when we dive deeply into something. If you want your kids to self engage, you&rsquo;ll need to organize creative learning projects rather than assign them task work.</p>\n<p>For example, I was struggling to keep my son&rsquo;s attention on his school work. He wanted to focus on Ancient Rome. He&rsquo;d become passionately interested, I can&rsquo;t remember how, in that subject. So I started pushing all other subjects into that theme. Language? Study Latin (had to hire a tutor cause I don&rsquo;t know Latin). Math? Roman numerals and other types of commerce and engineering skills. Art? Dioramas of Roman homes. Reading? Mythology. We ventured into areas I wouldn&rsquo;t have known to go. And I had no trouble demonstrating academic progress at the end.</p>\n<p>I imagine that kids who are home temporarily because of the virus will have work assigned. Cool. But what about the rest of the day? What would they love to explore? Can they be set up to explore it on their own?</p>\n<h2 id=\"trust-learning-to-emerge\">Trust learning to emerge</h2>\n<p>At the end of each year, I had to prove to the state that my son had learned sufficient stuff. (These rules vary by state in the US.) One year, I was struggling to put together a package of proof and concerned because in some areas, like English, we hadn&rsquo;t made as much progress as I&rsquo;d planned. I was also behind in grading his math work because by then, he was better than me in math so it took me longer, even with the teacher&rsquo;s edition.</p>\n<p>I decided to take us on a train trip to Glacier National Park. We&rsquo;d wrap up our year&rsquo;s work on the journey and then hike for a few days.</p>\n<p>Side note: my son never enjoyed hiking, ruining all illusion that you can expose your kids to things and they will automagically like them.</p>\n<p>On the train, we talked about his new obsession, MUDding (digital, text-based fantasy games). MUDs were also my new obsession but we only sometimes played together. As we talked, I realized that he had written reams of fantasy and science fiction over the last six months as part of his play. He&rsquo;d read about 20 books, for fun. If my English &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; had been character development, plot, story, theme etc &hellip; he&rsquo;d have done far more work than a usual course would require. So, I changed my curriculum, gathered his work, and included it in the package.</p>\n<p>I also gave him his math work to grade while I did so. He was better at that too, explaining to me where and why he&rsquo;d made mistakes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-interrupt-creative-discomfort\">Don&rsquo;t interrupt creative discomfort</h2>\n<p>As people settle into creative play, they become uncomfortable. We flop around like fish in the bottom of a boat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t waaaaannnnaaa go outside&rdquo;, we say. Then, we don&rsquo;t want to come back in when the sun goes down because we&rsquo;ve built a fort and are busy hanging out with the faeries.</p>\n<p>Three mistakes are common and crucial to avoid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Do not fix this discomfort</em> by taking it (too) seriously. Let them flop around and complain they are bored. Be careful about recommending things, my son would explicitly NOT do something just because I suggested it. Give them some time to find their own fun.</li>\n<li><em>Do not let them turn on the television</em> (or any other distraction) to avoid the floppiness. We didn&rsquo;t own a TV, which solved that challenge. But we did own computers and we were on them a lot, which is the same thing when a distraction is sought. Ensure there is time when it&rsquo;s all off.</li>\n<li><em>Do not give them sugar</em>. (White flour foods is also sugar.) Well, go ahead, give them sugar, that&rsquo;s the best way to ensure you never want to do so again. Floppy time isn&rsquo;t a time for revving up, it&rsquo;s a time for finding flow. Real food won&rsquo;t artificially distract from the creative discomfort.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ask-them-to-teach-you\">Ask them to teach you</h2>\n<p>One of my favorite ways to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; my son into learning was to ask him to teach me how to do something. Almost everyone loves to demonstrate expertise. By the time he was six, I would bring home a new appliance and leave the box unopened. He&rsquo;d set it up, read the manual and show me how to use it. When I bought my first new car, he was 11. He took the manual to bed with him and the next day, walked me through the features.</p>\n<p>Other parents have told me stories about kids baking bread and teaching them about different approaches, taking apart a radio and explaining how it works, building a rabbit coop, figuring out vacation options. The goal of &ldquo;knowing something&rdquo; is often far more appealing than the goal of learning something.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stop-work-early-if-you-can\">Stop work early, if you can</h2>\n<p>5pm is the absolute worst time of day, in my experience. 6pm, if we were still trying to &ldquo;get things done&rdquo;, even worse. There&rsquo;s a reason why Thoreau went for a walk every afternoon. There is only so much sustained energy we can put into a day before we need to pause, go outside, do something with our hands, read a book &hellip; settle into something other than grinding out what &ldquo;needs&rdquo; to get done.</p>\n<p>Especially when kids are in the mix. My son is an adult now, an adult who owns his own home and pings me funny Imgur links in Slack during the work day. Yet my evenings are still difficult if I&rsquo;ve worked too long without a &ldquo;play&rdquo; break.</p>\n<p>If at all possible, during this time of isolation, try to find the magic hidden in the late afternoons. It&rsquo;s there. When we miss it, we never really renew our energy.</p>\n<p>And I imagine you need all the energy you can muster right now. I&rsquo;m with you in spirit.</p>",

I am often &ldquo;too much&rdquo; of something or other. I am devoted to people I love even as it might seem like I don&rsquo;t pay attention.

I am bizarrely intuitive (my husband calls it my spidey sense.) I talk a lot, even though I am an introvert.

My hairdresser says  I am the only client who tells her the circumstances in which my hair will be expressing itself. I said &ldquo;why would I tell you specifically how to cut my hair?

I was told that I only wanted a PhD so I can &ldquo;have a nameplate on my desk&rdquo;. (So I didn&rsquo;t get one.) I &ldquo;need to live in the real world&rdquo;. I &ldquo;think too much.&rdquo; Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been ousted, in a few still-painful ways, despite bringing trustworthy and, I think, valuable change.

Leveling up my crack accoutrements rather than, you know, going to rehab.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The enough lessons must be sinking in because I caught myself. This morning I was terrified to write. A few weeks from now, I&rsquo;m giving a talk at a conference of people I value and respect. The text of the talk is evolving into things I <em>really</em> want to say and includes insights I <em>truly</em> value. So, of course, I&rsquo;m scared to say those things. To risk that. And I&rsquo;m super scared I won&rsquo;t finish writing it, with slides, in time and it&rsquo;ll suck. I&rsquo;ll suck. You know how it is, the fear talking.</p>\n<p>I <em>want</em> to say what I&rsquo;m planning to say. I hope others will find the talk valuable. But the truth is <em>I&rsquo;m</em> not the key factor here. Wisdom arises.  It emerges and finds its path like water; flows. Wise thinking isn&rsquo;t produced or created or generated or done, you can&rsquo;t sit down and make it like a summer camp popsicle stick basket. Wisdom isn&rsquo;t yours to share, you can only listen and integrate and write and get out of the way.</p>\n<p>Most of what I say and think is not wise. I&rsquo;m also not a big Get Out of the Way gal. But I crave the experience of stumbling into knowing something valuable and transformative, an experience I don&rsquo;t get very often. I fail and fail when I try to articulate things but wisdom is always the goal. The sweetest most precious goal we can fail at, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>I was afraid to write so instead, I made a list of other things I hoped todo today. Just to &ldquo;get them off my mind.&rdquo; I walked around the house with my notebook. At first, this helped. My day was organizing and prioritizing itself on paper.</p>\n<p>Then, quickly, the list became overwhelming. I persevered, of course, adding everything I could think of and next thing I knew, I wasn&rsquo;t writing OR doing those things. I was sitting on the couch holding my notebook looking dazed and stuffed, like Thanksgiving. I hadn&rsquo;t even opened Todoist yet.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Why do I do this to myself?</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve been organizing my reading (past, present and future) in LibraryThing. Which.I.Love. I felt wonderfully relaxed this week once I set up my account, imported from Goodreads and began creating more lists. I felt energized. I&rsquo;ve been ordering books. This morning, I ordered five more titles that I&rsquo;m excited to read. Plus put a few on my Kobo. And added four audio books because I had credits.</p>\n<p>Now, if you are a normal person, you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;when will she read all those books?&rdquo; If you are not a normal person, which is highly possible given that you are reading this post and therefore, probably know me, trust me when I say that question is reasonable to ask right now.</p>\n<p>The answer is, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m reading five or six books at the moment plus feel pressure to read the five or six I <em>should</em> be reading while preparing for the talk. Sometimes, I don&rsquo;t remember which book I&rsquo;m reading when I sit down to read. So I strategically leave my books or kobo in spots, like next to the bathtub, to prompt myself. Some books are Car Rides Only. Overstory (omg its wonderful) was a beloved car companion for a couple months (I don&rsquo;t drive often) and I miss it now.</p>\n<p>During <a href=\"http://www.corynakasue.com/\">exercises with Cory</a> yesterday, I discovered that I only inhale and exhale as much as is necessary. I rarely finish an exhale and am not sure what &ldquo;inhale to your collar bones&rdquo; means. This is how I live my life. I bring in what I need but I rarely make sufficient space to fully enjoy it or to fully release when it&rsquo;s over. I love to cook. I avoid the dishes.</p>\n<p>The contraction in my breathing and my ribcage that we are releasing is my fear of never having enough time, energy and attention to really, truly settle into learning, reading, doing, experiencing, thinking, creating, etc. I don&rsquo;t trust it. I don&rsquo;t trust life to nourish and support me doing it. I control my attention so I stay just shallow enough to Get Shit Done. To Be Who I&rsquo;m Supposed to Be. Something the world constantly rewards me for.</p>\n<p>When we stop doing &ldquo;enough&rdquo; of what is rewarded or expected, we may put ourselves in economic and relational peril. The fear isn&rsquo;t simply in our minds. It is legitimately risky to let go and be authentic. Brene Brown is coaching the whole world on how to do this &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s that fricken hard. Buddhism has been teaching it for a bazillion years but Buddha was monastic so there&rsquo;s a limit to how much those teaching help us. We&rsquo;ve got to take risks and figure it out as we go and that&rsquo;s hard.</p>\n<p>The first time I noticed my pattern, I googled &ldquo;hoarding todos.&rdquo; No relevant results. But I&rsquo;m sure its a thing. I&rsquo;m constantly hoarding things to do or get or start or fix or change or WHATEVER to protect myself from being bored. I was pathologically bored as a kid and young adult. I can not tolerate how shallow and superficial many social transactions or experiences can feel. But, I thought, that was life. You must learn to deal with it, get by. I couldn&rsquo;t drown and I couldn&rsquo;t swim so I learned to grasp any complex, interesting or intractable mental challenges to keep me afloat. Keep them as close as I could, stacking them inside while externally doing things I was supposed to do.</p>\n<p>I loved feeling full of impossible but maybe satisfying things to do. Until I couldn&rsquo;t fit anymore in. Things weren&rsquo;t leaving, being done, at the same rate I brought them in. Not by a long shot. My inner world became a dense black hole. Does a black hole have a maximum density? If so, I reached mine.</p>\n<p>Now what?</p>\n<p>Well, my first practice is learning to take full breaths. I know this seems simple but is it? Not for me. Breathe and feel the ground supporting me, letting myself occupy space. Release, let go, be nourished. Ha! Oh, that sounds tritely easy but have you tried it? I&rsquo;m not a big fan of this work, I confess, but its good and right and I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>\n<p>Second practice is to let myself trust that Enough Enjoyable Things to Do are out there and I can go find them, do them, any time. The metaphor that comes to mind is &ldquo;My collection of seashells can live on the beaches of the world.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t need to capture items on my lists, though I can, if that&rsquo;s fun, which it is, as long as I remember my lists are fiction. I don&rsquo;t need to stress about anything I don&rsquo;t do because if I didn&rsquo;t do it &hellip; I did not choose to do it. I get to choose.</p>\n<p>I can read more yet feel happily surrounded by more than I can (or will) read. I can live in the middle of the world&rsquo;s library and that can be enough.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, I can finish writing this (which is awesome because remember, I was afraid to write?!) then go do something renewing. Like play a game with my husband or go out to &hellip;. and the next three things I was about to write were Tasks dressed up like Renewing things. Man, I&rsquo;ve got a ways to go. Many tasks <em>are</em> renewing, but those cheeky buggers stack up and merge into Getting Shit Done before I know it.</p>\n<p>My joyful rule today will be: Ground myself in being home and do only things that increase my inner energy level. Recharge my battery so I can continue doing scary but valuable things.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know how that goes &hellip;</p>",

You know how it is, the fear talking.\n\nI *want* to say what I'm planning to say. I hope others will find the talk valuable. But the truth is *I'm* not the key factor here. Wisdom arises.  It emerges and finds its path like water; flows. Wise thinking isn't produced or created or generated or done, you can't sit down and make it like a summer camp popsicle stick basket. Wisdom isn't yours to share, you can only listen and integrate and write and get out of the way.\n\nMost of what I say and think is not wise. I'm also not a big Get Out of the Way gal. But I crave the experience of stumbling into knowing something valuable and transformative, an experience I don't get very often. I fail and fail when I try to articulate things but wisdom is always the goal. The sweetest most precious goal we can fail at, isn't it?\n\nI was afraid to write so instead, I made a list of other things I hoped todo today. Just to \"get them off my mind.\" I walked around the house with my notebook. At first, this helped. My day was organizing and prioritizing itself on paper.\n\nThen, quickly, the list became overwhelming. I persevered, of course, adding everything I could think of and next thing I knew, I wasn't writing OR doing those things. I was sitting on the couch holding my notebook looking dazed and stuffed, like Thanksgiving. I hadn't even opened Todoist yet.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnbNcQlzV-4?start=16\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWhy do I do this to myself?\n\nMeanwhile, I've been organizing my reading (past, present and future) in LibraryThing. Which.I.Love. I felt wonderfully relaxed this week once I set up my account, imported from Goodreads and began creating more lists. I felt energized. I've been ordering books. This morning, I ordered five more titles that I'm excited to read. Plus put a few on my Kobo. And added four audio books because I had credits.\n\nNow, if you are a normal person, you're wondering \"when will she read all those books?\" If you are not a normal person, which is highly possible given that you are reading this post and therefore, probably know me, trust me when I say that question is reasonable to ask right now.\n\nThe answer is, I don't know. I'm reading five or six books at the moment plus feel pressure to read the five or six I *should* be reading while preparing for the talk. Sometimes, I don't remember which book I'm reading when I sit down to read. So I strategically leave my books or kobo in spots, like next to the bathtub, to prompt myself. Some books are Car Rides Only. Overstory (omg its wonderful) was a beloved car companion for a couple months (I don't drive often) and I miss it now.\n\nDuring [exercises with Cory](http://www.corynakasue.com/) yesterday, I discovered that I only inhale and exhale as much as is necessary. I rarely finish an exhale and am not sure what \"inhale to your collar bones\" means. This is how I live my life. I bring in what I need but I rarely make sufficient space to fully enjoy it or to fully release when it's over. I love to cook. I avoid the dishes.\n\nThe contraction in my breathing and my ribcage that we are releasing is my fear of never having enough time, energy and attention to really, truly settle into learning, reading, doing, experiencing, thinking, creating, etc. I don't trust it. I don't trust life to nourish and support me doing it. I control my attention so I stay just shallow enough to Get Shit Done. To Be Who I'm Supposed to Be. Something the world constantly rewards me for.\n\nWhen we stop doing \"enough\" of what is rewarded or expected, we may put ourselves in economic and relational peril. The fear isn't simply in our minds. It is legitimately risky to let go and be authentic. Brene Brown is coaching the whole world on how to do this 'cause it's that fricken hard. Buddhism has been teaching it for a bazillion years but Buddha was monastic so there's a limit to how much those teaching help us. We've got to take risks and figure it out as we go and that's hard.\n\nThe first time I noticed my pattern, I googled \"hoarding todos.\" No relevant results. But I'm sure its a thing. I'm constantly hoarding things to do or get or start or fix or change or WHATEVER to protect myself from being bored. I was pathologically bored as a kid and young adult. I can not tolerate how shallow and superficial many social transactions or experiences can feel. But, I thought, that was life. You must learn to deal with it, get by. I couldn't drown and I couldn't swim so I learned to grasp any complex, interesting or intractable mental challenges to keep me afloat. Keep them as close as I could, stacking them inside while externally doing things I was supposed to do.\n\nI loved feeling full of impossible but maybe satisfying things to do. Until I couldn't fit anymore in. Things weren't leaving, being done, at the same rate I brought them in. Not by a long shot. My inner world became a dense black hole. Does a black hole have a maximum density? If so, I reached mine.\n\nNow what?\n\nWell, my first practice is learning to take full breaths. I know this seems simple but is it? Not for me. Breathe and feel the ground supporting me, letting myself occupy space. Release, let go, be nourished. Ha! Oh, that sounds tritely easy but have you tried it? I'm not a big fan of this work, I confess, but its good and right and I'm doing it.\n\nSecond practice is to let myself trust that Enough Enjoyable Things to Do are out there and I can go find them, do them, any time. The metaphor that comes to mind is \"My collection of seashells can live on the beaches of the world.\" I don't need to capture items on my lists, though I can, if that's fun, which it is, as long as I remember my lists are fiction. I don't need to stress about anything I don't do because if I didn't do it ... I did not choose to do it. I get to choose.\n\nI can read more yet feel happily surrounded by more than I can (or will) read. I can live in the middle of the world's library and that can be enough.\n\nMost importantly, I can finish writing this (which is awesome because remember, I was afraid to write?!) then go do something renewing. Like play a game with my husband or go out to .... and the next three things I was about to write were Tasks dressed up like Renewing things. Man, I've got a ways to go. Many tasks *are* renewing, but those cheeky buggers stack up and merge into Getting Shit Done before I know it.\n\nMy joyful rule today will be: Ground myself in being home and do only things that increase my inner energy level. Recharge my battery so I can continue doing scary but valuable things.\n\nI'll let you know how that goes ...\n",

Simultanously, I am developing muscles I‚Äôve never had and always needed.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Today is Day 8 and my inner resistance to sitting at my desk is solidifying, concretizing. Simultaneously, surprisingly, the rest of my day is deeper, with more productive joyful experiences. This change feels a tad miraculous, like drinking the antidote and discovering you&rsquo;d been poisoned for years.</p>\n<p>Perhaps my antidote, constructing something meaningful to say, is unique to me. The specifics certainly are; most people probably don&rsquo;t need to write in a journal for an hour every morning but I lose my inner compass if I don&rsquo;t. Other people might not need to read every day to prevent a malaise I call soul flu. Others might not need to constantly categorize and strategically design new patterns of thinking or restructure complex systems but oh my, I definitely do. Workbooks were my second favorite toy as a kid. I am bored without challenges and when I&rsquo;m bored, I engage in self-destructive (for me) activities. Like binging on shallow social exchanges that leave me feeling superficially connected, a survival technique I learned in high school. You may not need the same specific combination of exercises but you probably need your practices as much as I need mine.</p>\n<p>My resistance has always been with me. Each day, I&rsquo;d form it, like clay, into a list of things I must do. If I could get everything done -then- I could focus on more meaningful things. Done never arrived and it never will. When I did manage to move past my resistance, my fear other people&rsquo;s reactions to my abdication made me hyper vigilant, watching for trouble. There was always trouble. I was like a dysfunctional sea captain watching the ocean through binoculars from his house, dressed in sea captain garb, waiting for a ship to come in. Rather than sailing an actual boat.</p>\n<p>This morning, I set my Focus@Will timer for 90 minutes (Alpha Chill today) and opened IA Writer. When I have the draft done, I will move the text into Atom. I have a geeky, versioned-controlled workflow that generates this static site. Sometimes I sprinkle on a bit of code to the site itself.</p>\n<p>This process is working for me. And yet, like playing a video game, I encounter increasingly-strong challenges along the way. I thought &hellip; I really thought &hellip; these inner impediments, the monsters giving form to my resistance, were blockers. I felt shaky scared of them. Now, I see that (like in video games) these experiences are <em>strengtheners</em>.</p>\n<p>Let me say this again, because it&rsquo;s a gigantic revelation for me. <em>Resistance is our strengthener</em>. Resistance arises where a muscle needs to grow. In my case, choosing wordsmithing before Taking Care of All The Things creates core strength. Resistance is where my bodymind needs some weight to push against.</p>\n<p>This concept - resistance is a strengthener - is dangerous to generalize. How do we know the difference between healthy-for-us resistance and knowing something isn&rsquo;t good for us? Is it healthy resistance or are we forcing ourselves to do something we don&rsquo;t actually want to do?</p>\n<p>I will carry those question with me into day 9, 10 &hellip; and report back my findings. I push myself to do all manner of things that in fact, I&rsquo;d be better off not doing. I believed efforting and overcoming were strength. Horseradish. That&rsquo;s Sysphus and nobody wants to be Sisyphus.</p>\n<p>To help me discern between Sisyphus situations and experiences that grow my strength, I have developed five criteria. These are relatively new for me, I had to learn them all the hard way. Multiple times. Which gives me faith in their rightness, even if I still struggle to practice them consistently.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Are others hearing me?</em> I have invested many hours (months, years) repearing myself, trying to change other people&rsquo;s thinking, choices or behaviors. Saying the same thing again and again expected different responses is insanity. Don&rsquo;t go there. Change is a choice people make, not a thing you can gift them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Is there water in the well already?</em> When I discover a blindspot in a person or a situation, I usually encourage awareness to flow there. This is sometimes a worthwhile, loving effort. More often, it&rsquo;s like being thirsty, discovering a dry well, and rather than seek water elsewhere, start shoveling. There is no lack of water but there will never be a wellspring in a desert, my friends. Your garden needs the rain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Is developing expertise valuable in this situation?</em> I want to understand <em>everything</em> and everyone I encounter. Constant learning is joyful and I&rsquo;ve chosen a career that demands it. But true understanding requires time, energy and looking at things from many points of view. Is that work worthwhile? Sometimes. As Alanis Morrisette says, &ldquo;Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom.&rdquo; Relationships, with people and organizations, that have required developing specific-to-them knowledge have usually left me with little to show for my effort when the relationship ended. Now I&rsquo;m seeking balance and letting my inner compass quide me deeper my own expertise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Will others benefit from this effort?</em> As a woman, I was taught that selflessness, focus on others, is my natural state. All else is selfish or allowed &ldquo;me time&rdquo;. Horsewaddle. My work is valuable and requires my attention. But my work benefits no one if it&rsquo;s stuffed in a closet, where mine has literally been. Personal and professional development depends on hard work that has rarely been seen by others. But we aren&rsquo;t alone with our challenges. Others share them and ideally, we can help their journey be gentler.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This post has taken me four days to finish and lots of editing. At two points, this post was 3,000+ words long. I published it last night, thinking I was done. I wasn&rsquo;t. Words stockpiled themselves, demanding expression, damming the flow and making me feel stuck and overwhelmed. I chased many thought rabbits. My resistance made my body was heavy, bogged down. Emotionally, I felt unable to get out of my own way.</p>\n<p>Now, it is New Year&rsquo;s Day. The day I intended to tell others about Year of Enough and invite them to read it. So I&rsquo;m deciding this post is &ldquo;done enough&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s time to head into the 2020 unknown. I hope we travel together.</p>",

The specifics certainly are; most people probably don't need to write in a journal for an hour every morning but I lose my inner compass if I don't. Other people might not need to read every day to prevent a malaise I call soul flu. Others might not need to constantly categorize and strategically design new patterns of thinking or restructure complex systems but oh my, I definitely do. Workbooks were my second favorite toy as a kid. I am bored without challenges and when I'm bored, I engage in self-destructive (for me) activities. Like binging on shallow social exchanges that leave me feeling superficially connected, a survival technique I learned in high school. You may not need the same specific combination of exercises but you probably need your practices as much as I need mine.\n\nMy resistance has always been with me. Each day, I'd form it, like clay, into a list of things I must do. If I could get everything done -then- I could focus on more meaningful things. Done never arrived and it never will. When I did manage to move past my resistance, my fear other people's reactions to my abdication made me hyper vigilant, watching for trouble. There was always trouble. I was like a dysfunctional sea captain watching the ocean through binoculars from his house, dressed in sea captain garb, waiting for a ship to come in. Rather than sailing an actual boat.\n\nThis morning, I set my Focus@Will timer for 90 minutes (Alpha Chill today) and opened IA Writer. When I have the draft done, I will move the text into Atom. I have a geeky, versioned-controlled workflow that generates this static site. Sometimes I sprinkle on a bit of code to the site itself.\n\nThis process is working for me. And yet, like playing a video game, I encounter increasingly-strong challenges along the way. I thought ... I really thought ... these inner impediments, the monsters giving form to my resistance, were blockers. I felt shaky scared of them. Now, I see that (like in video games) these experiences are *strengtheners*.\n\nLet me say this again, because it's a gigantic revelation for me. _Resistance is our strengthener_. Resistance arises where a muscle needs to grow. In my case, choosing wordsmithing before Taking Care of All The Things creates core strength. Resistance is where my bodymind needs some weight to push against.\n\nThis concept - resistance is a strengthener - is dangerous to generalize. How do we know the difference between healthy-for-us resistance and knowing something isn't good for us? Is it healthy resistance or are we forcing ourselves to do something we don't actually want to do?\n\nI will carry those question with me into day 9, 10 ... and report back my findings. I push myself to do all manner of things that in fact, I'd be better off not doing. I believed efforting and overcoming were strength. Horseradish. That's Sysphus and nobody wants to be Sisyphus.\n\nTo help me discern between Sisyphus situations and experiences that grow my strength, I have developed five criteria. These are relatively new for me, I had to learn them all the hard way. Multiple times. Which gives me faith in their rightness, even if I still struggle to practice them consistently.\n\n1. *Are others hearing me?* I have invested many hours (months, years) repearing myself, trying to change other people's thinking, choices or behaviors. Saying the same thing again and again expected different responses is insanity. Don't go there. Change is a choice people make, not a thing you can gift them.\n\n2. *Is there water in the well already?* When I discover a blindspot in a person or a situation, I usually encourage awareness to flow there. This is sometimes a worthwhile, loving effort. More often, it's like being thirsty, discovering a dry well, and rather than seek water elsewhere, start shoveling. There is no lack of water but there will never be a wellspring in a desert, my friends. Your garden needs the rain.\n\n3. *Is developing expertise valuable in this situation?* I want to understand *everything* and everyone I encounter. Constant learning is joyful and I've chosen a career that demands it. But true understanding requires time, energy and looking at things from many points of view. Is that work worthwhile? Sometimes. As Alanis Morrisette says, \"Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom.\" Relationships, with people and organizations, that have required developing specific-to-them knowledge have usually left me with little to show for my effort when the relationship ended. Now I'm seeking balance and letting my inner compass quide me deeper my own expertise.\n\n4. *Will others benefit from this effort?* As a woman, I was taught that selflessness, focus on others, is my natural state. All else is selfish or allowed \"me time\". Horsewaddle. My work is valuable and requires my attention. But my work benefits no one if it's stuffed in a closet, where mine has literally been. Personal and professional development depends on hard work that has rarely been seen by others. But we aren't alone with our challenges. Others share them and ideally, we can help their journey be gentler.\n\nThis post has taken me four days to finish and lots of editing. At two points, this post was 3,000+ words long. I published it last night, thinking I was done. I wasn't. Words stockpiled themselves, demanding expression, damming the flow and making me feel stuck and overwhelmed. I chased many thought rabbits. My resistance made my body was heavy, bogged down. Emotionally, I felt unable to get out of my own way.\n\nNow, it is New Year's Day. The day I intended to tell others about Year of Enough and invite them to read it. So I'm deciding this post is \"done enough\". It's time to head into the 2020 unknown. I hope we travel together.\n",

Perhaps you think I&rsquo;ve lost my f&rsquo;n mind. If so, I&rsquo;ll whisper this in response &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gained my mind.&rdquo;  I have arrived in a mental space where I <em>crave</em> plants, especially fresh produce grown nearby.

That was not true before.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where you draw the line, my question is this: Rather than give up this food or that food, seeking moderation &hellip; what would it be like to simply eat food in its natural state?

But our bodies are not made happy by a birthday cake -- we are drugged by the birthday cake. There's a difference. We go to the doctor to treat our diet-related diseases but we will never be cured by a system that profits from the rise in them.\n\nI know this post may seem radical and vigilante. Perhaps you think I've lost my f'n mind. If so, I'll whisper this in response \"I've gained my mind.\"  I have arrived in a mental space where I *crave* plants, especially fresh produce grown nearby. I add eggs or locally-raised meat (sometimes) and I am far more satisfied after eating than I ever was before. I eat three meals and I look forward to them. That was not true before.\n\nRegardless of where you draw the line, my question is this: Rather than give up this food or that food, seeking moderation ... what would it be like to simply eat food in its natural state? To buy, instead of manufactured food, ingredients?\n\n![Ingredients!](/images/ingredients.png)\n\nTrust me when I say, the happy holiday ending is a surprise to me. In my 20s, I subsisted on nicotine, air, Smartfood and drama. I did cook for my son, avoiding sugar (and was told by a friend that it was child abuse not feed a one-year-old birthday cake and Happy Meals.) Unfortunately, I cooked us many foods containing gluten, so made myself sicker in the process. My heart, diving deeper into authentic food, was in the right place though.\n\nHere are some foods I enjoyed over the holiday, including Christmas dinner. Over the next few days, I'll add links to recipes so you can enjoy them too.\n\n- Crispy brussel sprouts with pomegranate, walnut and cranberry pear balsamic\n- Pan-seared Filet mignon topped with fresh herb butter\n- Chocolate mousse parfait with strawberries, greek yogurt, pecans, walnuts and condimento drizzle\n- Beef stew thickened with butternut squash (Instant pot FTW)\n- Cauliflower-crust pizza with spinach, mushrooms and olive oil (meat optional)\n- [Farmer focus](https://www.svorganic.com/) chicken wings with buffalo sauce\n- Kale Caesar salad (we eat this almost every day)\n- Creamy blueberry and pecan quick dessert\n- Individual squash pie (side dish, great with roasted chicken)\n\nNeed some inspired reading to encourage you towards cooking?

I write this post on the 22nd of December, amidst our annual resurrection of Eve&rsquo;s mythic original sin, Mary&rsquo;s disembodied virtue and subtextually, the vanquishing of demon Lilith who doesn&rsquo;t obey Men who are God.

We have certainly erased an essential element needed to thrive in it. Goddess. Where is she in our stories? She is always, also, a source of our strength. Our balance.

To trust that I am allowed, fully and completely, to own and craft my experiences.</p>\n<p>Here, I am enough. Here, there is enough. I am free to work, deeply connected.

Until I learned that failure to obey (mostly male) demands for my time, energy and attention caused more suffering than I could endure (then).\n\nMy garden is brown, overgrown with unfriendly weeds. The sky is gray and the soil is dry. There are no birds. Isolated from daily tending, denied the careful loving attention of my creativity, intelligence and self-awareness, my garden has withered. I was elsewhere, trusting the world to give back nourishment eventually, if I did right things. It didn't. The world doesn't. Our garden is ours to tend.\n\nDespite the current quiet emptiness, my inner garden whispers of extraordinariness. I sense the awesomeness of power available within.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.montalion.com/uploads/2024/purple-gate.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\">\n\nPerhaps we all have an inner space where we *know* our original connection to a lush sustaining world. Where our thoughts are nourished not by advertising but by sun, plants, the interplay of ecosystems and weather patterns. Where our daily work is surrounded by the moving sounds of rain and growing self awareness. In our garden, we are complete, blessed by abundance. Right sized.\n\nThis metaphor is fraught, yes? I write this post on the 22nd of December, amidst our annual resurrection of Eve's mythic original sin, Mary's disembodied virtue and subtextually, the vanquishing of demon Lilith who doesn't obey Men who are God. Hallelujah.\n\nThere is a tree decorated in my home. I didn't know until recently that the Christmas tree is connected to the Eden tree which, according to some, originated on Adam and Eve day, December 24th. The story of how we, especially women, don't deserve our place in the garden.\n\nPerhaps we simply forget this space, while lost in the world. We have certainly erased an essential element needed to thrive in it. Goddess. Where is she in our stories? She is always, also, a source of our strength. Our balance. Resurrecting our awareness of metaphorical divine feminine is, I think, key to coming home. Rebalancing and revitalizing our understanding of the world that sustains us.\n\nIt is not a man's world unless we believe it is.\n\nToday, I begin carefully re-cultivating my inner garden. I begin with the most essential vow: to arrive. Then: to stay. To rest and think here, to drink the fresh water of good ideas. To trust that I am allowed, fully and completely, to own and craft my experiences.\n\nHere, I am enough. Here, there is enough. I am free to work, deeply connected. I am free to become a work of art.\n",

I&rsquo;ve worked very hard to arrive here. But many people work very hard and are struggling against forces they can not control. When I was poor, there was never &ldquo;enough&rdquo;.

I live in a hilltop house, surrounded by four acres. I love my house. And it&rsquo;s so much work. Most days, I feel crushed by all I don&rsquo;t do. I fear I will lose the house if I don&rsquo;t have money. So I work harder in my career, which means less time for housework. Then I feel crushed by both.

This is a nascent experience for me, one I&rsquo;m committed to exploring. I already see that I make better choices when I feel enough.
