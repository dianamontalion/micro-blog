			 <p>After watching the movie Anatomy of a Fall, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. It is a psychologically chilling, and familiar, experience of what happens when a woman is vulnerable to the judgement of men. The tone and patterns are the background music of our lives. I&rsquo;m grateful it exists, it turns up the volume.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done a great job staying connected &ndash; for reasons I&rsquo;ve described here. But I want you to know that I&rsquo;m with you and feeling grateful.</p>
<p>This year, there was no holiday celebration at my house. Unless you count the dogs joyfully destroying stuffed toys in 10 minutes on Christmas morning. I definitely count that. Both Dom and I had Covid. Stuffing was strewn everywhere for two weeks, neither of us had the energy for sweeping.</p>
<p>This morning, I am on my way to NYC for a doctor’s appt. She’s going to tell me that I’m okay, recovery just takes time. She’ll encourage me to keep resting. Over the holiday, when I asked her what to do, she said, “Rest. I suspect you don’t know what “rest” means, so let me define it for you.”</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t have much choice. Everyday I hoped I’d be better; everyday I wasn’t (much). I still get winded climbing the stairs.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Day, I did what was previously unthinkable — I cancelled a six-week course I was teaching starting in January. I cancelled an upcoming speaking engagement in London later this month. I made time and space to recover. Now, I just need to figure out what &ldquo;recover&rdquo; means.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, and you’d be right, that I did too much in 2023. Too much travel, too many deadlines, too much working everyday ”temporarily&quot;. I did nowhere near enough self care. Or exercise. Or reading snarky sci-fi novels.</p>
<p>On Boxing Day, while I played Chants of Santaar with Dom (a game my son recommended), we realized that we hadn’t spent a day playing together in … we couldn’t remember the last time. I&rsquo;m sad it took &ldquo;trying not to cough so hard I cracked my ribs&rdquo; to sit me down for a fun afternoon together.</p>
<p>In my defense, I did many wonderful things in 2023. Things I’ve hoped to do all my life. I have grown in valuable ways. I don&rsquo;t regret it. I wrote two books (both are nearly done). I taught an online course, gave keynotes and workshops at wonderful events. Podcasters interviewed me with insightful questions. I developed immersive learning experiences with other people who taught me so much. I met knowledgable, inspiring colleagues from around the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made new friends. Never in my life have I been this socially nourished and satisfied. In August, I began a new project with a savvy client, some of my favorite people are building it with me. We are doing difficult things together. I look forward to showing up for the work, which is a true luxury.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say, though, that I “enjoyed” all the work I&rsquo;ve been doing. Mostly, I stressed about it. I was always afraid that I wasn’t doing enough, fast enough, publishing enough, juggling it all. By mid-year, I started dropping balls. While pretending (to myself) that I’d pick them up again soon. I met most external deadlines but my newsletter hasn&rsquo;t been published in six months. Always feeling behind, even when I kept up, was rough. The whole year was a cruel lesson in … I won’t say balance because I detest that word but, okay, balance. Or rather, imbalance.</p>
<p>I think &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; means &ldquo;create a rhythm that is sustainable&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s &hellip; a foreign concept. One I don&rsquo;t love because, I suspect, stress has been my fuel.</p>
<p>My anxiety level was so bad by September, I started asking for help. And discovered … to my utter shock and amazement … that I have ADHD. I can’t fathom how someone so self aware could have missed something (for half a century) that now seems so obvious. I am neurodivergent in a few ways, like a Venn Diagram, but this discovery (and the medication) has started me down a new path.</p>
<p>On this new path, I am learning to measure my energy and renew it every day. Rather than seek stimulation, in the form of caffeine or stress of worry or drama or fear. Rather than keep push push pushing. This, isn&rsquo;t easy for me. I like pushing.</p>
<p>I see now that I have been living on “hard mode”. Rather than creating systems of support, I push through blockers that are, to some extent, immovable. For example, rather than prioritize projects and then decline whatever doesn&rsquo;t make the cut &hellip; I try to get it all done. As if magic hours will suddenly appear. I focus on self discipline and time management strategies.</p>
<p>I probably don&rsquo;t need more self discipline, or management strategies. I probably need to rest between tasks and do things that nourish and support me, so I can thrive. I probably need to take a deep breath.</p>
<p>My brain confuses me. That&rsquo;s my biggest obstacle &ndash; feeling confused by my own process. Some things that are easy for others, like prioritizing, are super hard for me. And some things, like orchestrating complex initiatives, are relatively easy. Reading is rest; socializing is tiring. Days off are stressful &hellip; depending on how I define &ldquo;off&rdquo;. Off from what?</p>
<p>Now, slowly (very slowly), I am figuring out how to do hard things on easy mode. At the moment, I don&rsquo;t really understand the concept. I understand, for example, that exercise makes doing hard things easier. I don’t actually know how to show up for exercise without making it another TODO.</p>
<p>Covid has been my teacher. An abusive and overly-dramatic teacher, a teacher that can go fuck herself. But constraints, when viewed wisely, improve the system as a whole. I hope I am making wiser choices.</p>
<p>If I am wiser, it’s only because of my friends and colleagues. The people around me in 2023 have given me a treasure trove of good guidance. I hate that I owe almost everyone an email response. I wanted to send everyone a Happy New Year note &ndash; an apology for not having been in touch lately. And a commitment to do better, connect more often, in 2024.</p>
<p>More importantly, I want you to know (you know who you are) that I am thinking of you. And grateful, every day, that you shared your time, energy and attention. If I&rsquo;m quiet for awhile, it&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m learning to take better care of myself &hellip; you have helped me understand that matters to do. I&rsquo;m right here, with you.</p>

<p>I resist bringing my full attention back to focused work, like a toddler who doesn’t want her face washed. Even though, focus is joy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am sitting on a tall Ikea stool, writing on my iPad at the kitchen counter, in an apartment on Madrid Etorbidea in the Amara neighborhood of San Sebastian, Spain. I am at the epicenter of my spring journey. Alone here in this space between social adventures. I am clearing up work that has been neglected and creating new things for upcoming events.</p>
<p>The dishwasher is whirring, cleaning my coffee mugs and overnight-oats bowl. The neighbors are leaving for work or school, chatting in a language I don’t understand. My husband, who was raised here and speaks fluent Spanish, left two days ago. Yesterday, I ventured out to the market for the first time alone, having practiced “Lo siento, no hablo español” many times. People were very nice about it. Some spoke English with me, some just gave me what I pointed at, the Cherimoya and the banana (plantain?). I feel braver now. Later, I will walk along the river to the old town, eat gluten-free pintxos and read <em>The House on Mango Street</em>, my beloved book companion found in a local bookshop’s small but excellent English section.</p>
<p>I’m tired, finally resting. Before I left, there was the messy chaos of preparation — the early release of my book, making materials for the talks I’m giving and the workshops I’m teaching, re-starting an online course and editing the self-published book that goes with it. Most challengingly of all was the strategic packing, fitting exactly what I’d need for my seven-week journey around Europe into a carry on, and no more.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that I was stressed. That is really fucking fair to say.</p>
<p>(Perhaps you see the “f” word as empty bottles of soda and cardboard containers for fries, carelessly tossed out, blighting an otherwise lovely sentence. I don’t find swearing litter. A well-placed swear is spice, an accent, a decoration that perks up a room, an attention-focusing art object. A swear is punctuation. I swear in any company, which is perhaps not my best quality but something I apprectiate about myself, the willingness to say exactly what I mean.)</p>
<p>This week, there is much work to do, preparing for the next steps of my journey. Learning experiences to cocreate with an inspiring and talented team, a book chapter to finish, an agenda to finish for the writing workshop where, for the first time since Covid, I’ll be in a room with people writing together. There’s social media to feed, like I’m a Sea World trainer and it’s a dolphin.</p>
<p>I don’t wanna. I resist bringing my full attention back to focused work, like a toddler who doesn’t want her face washed. After a week in Bucharest, teaching and speaking with super smart cohorts and attendees, where we formed a temporary speaker family in Discord, stayed up late drinking kamaze shots and smoking a usually-verbotten cigarette. Where we visited castles together, napping in the van on the drive up. After a romantic week with my husban eating all the amazing food in San Sebastian (Akalerre is heaven on earth), hiking the beautiful trail along the ocean, cheering for the local soccer (fútbol) team from pitch-side seats.</p>
<p>I need to calm down, settle in, let the pursuit of other people’s company, the hunt for perfecto gluten-free Basque cheesecake, the seeking of external pleasure … go.</p>
<p>Let it go. Let go of seeking happiness and find it (again) in solitude. In my work. In my movement practice and doing the dishes and reading a book and, especially, in writing. As delightful as the world around me is, it can never satisfy me the way gathering my attention can.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are making a dubious face, doubtful and confused. I wouldn’t blame you. Especially if you are American, like me, raised in the land of “consuming is the path to happiness”. What I’ve discovered is, I don’t need anything to make me happy. Happy is what I naturally am. I only need to remember.</p>
<p>Yes, there are things and experiences that absolutely make me happy Akellare! Fútbol! My dogs, my home, my car. Money enough to take care of them. (Poverty does not make me happy.) In the past, I have put myself in situations that were fundamentally untrustworthy, unstable, unconcerned with who I am authentically. Situations that didn’t love me back. I needed to leave those situations in order to be happy.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that I don’t need or want anything. Of course I do. I am not saying that I would be happy in a Siberian prison, there are fundamental necessities.</p>
<p>I’m saying that I’ve lost decades of my life running around desperately trying to find happiness when it was hidden inside of me all along. Like Dorothy, I went to Oz and discovered there’s no place like home. Home is my own experience. Solitude, connection without consuming, my ability to love my work and trust that it loves me back.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t slide effortlessly and easily into solitude, like it’s comfie slippers or sweatpants. I cling to the fun, wishing it was never ending, that life was the Guardians of the Galaxy ride in Epcot. More cheesecake! I crave the attention of my peers. I feel homesick.</p>
<p>Yesterday, rather than enjoying the work, I made a task lists and checked the items off, driven by fear economic ruin if I don’t do enough, work enough, know strategically the correct business decisions to make today. ANSWER EMAILS. I’m anxious and afraid, it’s easier to do things that calm my fear, like double checking travel arrangements, invoicing, or proactively communicate so nobody is angry or frustrated with me.</p>
<p>What I want most in life is wisdom. Hearing the voice of wisdom requires letting go of the noise and listening for the signal. Doing deep work that matters. As much as I love the Basque cheesecake, it will not nourish me.</p>
<p>Off, then, I go to nowhere, to make a cup of tea. To publish this post and work on the next chapter of my book and the workshop I’m teaching, alone and with a wonderful group of colleagues. To stretch and read and breathe.</p>
<p>I love my life. Truly deeply madly. I don’t need anything more right now. I don’t even want anything more than focus, the joyful creation of things. My pleasure-seeking brain still balks at doing yoga or opening my laptop. I wonder if I’ll always feel this resistance, distracted by the desire to go elsewhere, do something else, even when everything I need or want is right here. Perhaps.</p>
<p>Perhaps all I can ever do is practice coming home.</p>

<p>This week, my intention was to be more mindful when attending online work meetings. As I did, I noticed something: I’ve constructed a Me Who Goes to Meetings.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="me-who-goes-to-meetings">Me Who Goes to Meetings</h2>
<p>Me Who Goes to Meetings isn’t the same me who meditates with other women or rides her bike in digital cycling classes or enjoys tea with friends. Me Who Goes to Meetings, it turns out, is an inextricable subset of My Professional Personhood.</p>
<p>This discovery was not a pleasant experience. I&rsquo;m quite attached to My Professional Personhood. I believed in her realness.</p>
<p>Recently, I decided to move my life in a different direction. Simultaneously, I have remained (purposefully?) fuzzy on the details. Now, I realize that this move is away from rigourous attachment to, a constant reinforcement of, my current Professional Personhood.</p>
<p>I don’t know what “different direction” means yet. I’m not even sure I “decided”, time and circumstances are simply acting on me, like they do. Things, they are-a-changin'. I see patterns in my life that I didn&rsquo;t see before.</p>
<p>Changing towards an unfamiliar Me brings up grief and resistance. A reactive entrenchment. My journal is full of deliberations, circutious questions that keep me stuck. As if, with enough negotiating and strategizing, I can make a positive change without actually <em>changing</em> anything.</p>
<p>I’m no hoarder, I’ve tossed away many things. I’ve ended numerous relationships. Sometimes smartly; sometimes stupidly; often it ended naturally as things changed. But letting go of Personhood is harder. I feel incredibly, unbearably insecure about my Personhood and yet, I will defend it like it’s the last meal I’ll ever eat. Honestly, I’d probably give up the meal more easily. I’d rather starve.</p>
<h2 id="personhood">Personhood</h2>
<p>What do you invest in your Personhood? How do you shore it up, animate it, make it Something Substantial?</p>
<p>Does that work? Are you satisfied? (If not, why continue?)</p>
<p>Tara Brach calls this effort our “Good Personhood Project”. I have deeply invested my time, energy and attention into reinforcing my Professional Personhood(tm). I expect a return on that investment. Some protection. I&rsquo;ve gotten both, so that&rsquo;d good. I also needed to believe that Me Who Goes to Meetings is, well, who I am. A believe that traps inevitably traps me in a persona.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there are authentic and meaningful outcomes in my work that I treasure. I am not an entirely <em>false</em> self. I am simply mixing delusional efforting into the slurry of daily experience, hoping to harden, to cement, my sense of power and control over my circumstances. By continuously building a Solid, Impenetrable Me. Especially when I feel vulnerable and exposed (which I sometimes do in meetings).</p>
<p>What is your Personhood made of?</p>
<h2 id="good-tools">Good tools</h2>
<p>There are many ways to apply good tools to the wrong job of constructing a self. My good tools have been bravery, persistance, open friendliness and curiosity. My wrong job has been building a tiny abode to house my Professional Personhood. Paint it with bright colors, mow the lawn.</p>
<p>It seemed big, when I began, my conceptual abode architected by fear (I don’t matter; I’m not enough). Be enough! Achieve unimaginable goals! Accomplish things. Sometimes, I am accomplishing things. That&rsquo;s cool. Usually, I am Sisyphusing the same rock up the same hill, trying to maintain delusion (mine and everyone else&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>When I use my good tools to reinforce that tiny space, again and again, <em>I miss millions of opportunities to use them to become free</em>.</p>
<h3 id="bravery">Bravery</h3>
<p>“As children, many of us were taught courage in the form of the warrior or the explorer, bravely facing danger. In the Buddhist understanding, however, great courage is not demonstrated by aggression or ambition. Aggression and ambition are more often expressions of fear and delusion. The courageous heart is the one that is unafraid to open to the world. With compassion we come to trust our capacity to open to life without armoring.” — Jack Kornfield, The Wise Heart</p>
<p>I have been brave in a profession that requires me to lean heavily on my confidence. To wring every last drop of self esteem (sometimes daily) from my inner world. To suit up. I took risks, stepped up, did stuff, suffered losses, recovered, took more risks.</p>
<p>My bravery was applied to proving myself and getting shit done. Speaking up to people (mostly men) who weren’t all that interested in what I had to say. Persevering, I produced meaningful, matterful results that I feel good about. Sometimes. Occasionally. Often enough to enjoy validating positive feedback: I have hutzpah.</p>
<p>I’ve got hutzpah. I brought hutzpah to the party. So why do I invest it, again and again, in proving my value to others? It’s very bad math. For all the times I am validated, seen, heard, matterful &hellip; there are more the times when I’m not. Nevertheless, I persist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which you are seeking is causing you to seek.&rdquo; &ndash; Cheri Huber, book of the same name</p>
<h3 id="persistance">Persistance</h3>
<p>Persistence is another good tool. I&rsquo;ve stuck with unworkable situations longer than is sane or rational. While struggling to devote myself to the daily practices that nourish and strengthen me.</p>
<p>What if I apply persistence towards connecting to an ever-deepening meaningfulness in my work? To mastery and the practice it requires. Go deeper, beyond striving to prove the work matters and I matter doing it. Listen to myself &ndash; see, hear and validate?</p>
<p>Care for my body as if it&rsquo;s the priority (it is), rather than stick &ldquo;hop on the treadmill for 20 mins&rdquo; on my calendar between Important Things that overshadow and crowd it out? What is more important than my health and wellbeing?</p>
<p>I can persist in taking iterative leaps of faith away from seeking security where it doesn’t exist &ndash; in Personhood. And rest in what matters most to me, the experience of doing the work itself. Trust my investment of time, energy and attention. Even when I’m afraid that investment won’t take good care of me in return.</p>
<p>Gah, that’s super scary, right?! Yeah, totes. Good thing I also have bravery.</p>
<h3 id="open-friendliness">Open friendliness</h3>
<p>Most of my family, friends and social media allies work in the same world I do. My limited social media life (Twitter) primarily involves talking about work. I am blessed by, satisfied with and nourished by the people in my real and virtual life.</p>
<p>I’m realizing, though, that the lack of diversity strengthens my Personhood. (Which is the genesis of all &lsquo;isms&rsquo;.) It reinforces the fear that architects my Personhood.</p>
<p>In my hidey hole, I feel less afraid that “other people  might not understand me”. Which is kinda dumb &lsquo;cause other people &lsquo;don&rsquo;t understand me&rsquo; all the time. <em>My work is illuminating areas of inquiry that aren&rsquo;t yet understood.</em></p>
<p>The lack of diversity (despite our diverse views about diverse things) has helped cement the boundaries of who I am &hellip; delimited by the work I currently do. I’m afraid to move outside those boundaries, back into circumstances where I feel like people didn&rsquo;t understand or like me. (Which was sometimes accurate.)</p>
<p>(People sometimes don&rsquo;t like me now.)</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>
<p>The Personhood investment I find hardest to relinquish is “having expertise”. Do you know that feeling? The pleasure and satisfaction of being someone who knows stuff? I love that feeling. I’m not sorry about this - I love learning things and submerging deeper into understanding. I am voraciously curious. Knowledge is satisfying.</p>
<p>The trippy part is when I think that my expertise, my knowledge, is Who I Am and What Makes Me Matter. When I become the Person Who Knows Things rather than, simply, learning and growing.</p>
<p>Learning is a fluid, changing, swimming type of experience. Knowing things is solid, cement like, a hammer. When my Personhood hijacks the deep process of learning, growing and discovering, I cling to my knowledge - even though it&rsquo;s heavy and holding me down. I can feel trapped. Suffocated.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;decision&rdquo; to take my life in different directions arose when I began to see something frightening: I have a profound desire to learn <em>other</em> things too. To grow in new directions. I&rsquo;ve limited myself to protect and defend my Personhood. Damn.</p>
<h2 id="and-so-the-journey-continues">And so, the journey continues</h2>
<p>Mindfulness practice is challenging and changing the way I invest my time, energy and attention. That’s a good thing. I’ve seen enough systemic patterns to trust my intention to transform rather than reinforce them. I am ready.</p>
<p>Yet, I am afraid, as if I am drowning in circumstances I can’t control. This is what change feels like. We are <em>always</em> in circumstances we can&rsquo;t control. Challenging Personhood triggers that realization &hellip; wanting the Feeling in Control was the reason we built a Personhood in the first place. It&rsquo;s recursive!</p>
<p>We are trying to spread our wings and fly while desperately clinging to the heavy things holding us down.</p>
<p>If we can sit and rest in that understanding, even for 5 minutes a day, we begin to see the teeny tiny box we built for ourselves. We might soften and experience all the possible “more”, the space outside of our tiny abode that opens up only when we aren’t focus on, striving towards, Personhood Reinforcement (again).</p>
<p>I’d love to say this change is Fun. Awesome! Give it a try! It is awesome. You should give it a try. It is also difficult. I want to honor the courage it takes to stop and wonder about this. Wanna stop and wonder &hellip; ?</p>
<p>What are the ways you construct and fortify Personhood?
What good tools do you use? How might you use them differently?
When you imagine exploring who you might be, outside your tiny inner abode, what do you fear?
Are you ready?</p>
<p>You are enough. You have always been enough. You will always be enough. Say it with me, &ldquo;I am enough.&rdquo; I can love and care about all of me, even the well-meaning Me Who Attends Meetings.</p>

<p>I’ve learned essential lessons about rest and renewal over the last decade. For example, renewing my energy is the most trustworthy bellwether of career satisfaction and success. Which surprised me. Pushing less hard is counterintuitive.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is mid-November, fall, where I live. Only kale and brussel sprouts remain in the garden. Soon, I&rsquo;ll tuck straw over the beds, like a blanket, so compost can nourish the soil through the winter. My garden is moving into rest and renew phase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m also in a brief rest and renewal phase, with five days off from work. Before this pause, I thought about how to use this time. What shall I do to feel revitalized by Monday?</p>
<p>The days off have been bumpy, varying from &ldquo;feeling more easeful than I&rsquo;ve felt in months&rdquo; to &ldquo;wicked anxious&rdquo;. Time off does that to me sometimes. I make resting a TO-DO and &ldquo;being rested&rdquo; the achievement.  Which is hardly restful, especially in the midst of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve learned essential lessons about rest and renewal over the last decade. I (surprisingly) discovered that choosing to renew my energy is the most trustworthy bellwether of career satisfaction and success. Which surprised me. Pushing <em>less</em> hard has always seemed counterintuitive.</p>
<p>What also surprised me was, I suck at resting and renewing. So, I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way how to do it. I&rsquo;ve also learned that everything in my life is better when I follow some foundational principles. Those principles are:</p>
<p><a href="#link-to-header">Encourage flow</a>. Renewing energy is different from relaxing. It involves <a href="#link-to-header">stimulating</a> the right kind of energy, <a href="#link-to-header">removing blockers</a> and <a href="#link-to-header">channelling that energy</a> so you can experience it.</p>
<p><a href="#link-to-header">Practice mastery</a> by staying grounded in what matters.</p>
<p><a href="#link-to-header">Strengthen inner integrity</a> by learning to respond instead of react. When resting and renewing, we step off the treadmill of achieving and instead cultivate self awareness and tending.</p>
<p>Apparently, I still like to test these principles - see what happens when I ignore them. SPOILER ALERT: Nothing good, long term. Perhaps you will do better &ndash; simple try them out, with easefulness, see how it goes?</p>
<h2 id="encourage-flow">Encourage flow</h2>
<p>“To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances.” ― Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</p>
<p>Resting and renewing recharges our batteries when they become low &ndash; which they do, everyday. Refilling our batteries requires sparking some energy, removing any blockers to its flow and channeling that energy in a direction.</p>
<p>Imagine a water wheel spinning next to a river, creating potential energy. The river must flow with sufficient velocity, within it&rsquo;s banks. The same amount of water sitting in a pond won&rsquo;t create energy. We use that energy to make something, to do work that transforms. When we rest and renew, we similarly apply our potential energy.</p>
<p>We experience the river when we, for example, ride our bike on a fall afternoon. Or paint a figurine, write a poem or plant vegetables in the garden. We experience the pond when we, for example, sit on the couch watching television. Both rivers and ponds have value. We simply need to discern &ndash; seeking energy from places that provide none will, well, provide none.</p>
<p>Many of us have been taught to look outside of ourselves for renewing experiences, Disney World or pretty scenery or vodka. But we are the wellspring from which we renew. Our attention, well placed, charges our battery. Our internal energy, well applied, renews us.</p>
<h3 id="not-necessarily-relaxation">Not necessarily relaxation</h3>
<p>When deciding to read this article, perhaps you expected recommendations like “buy bath salts,” “schedule ‘&ldquo;me time&rdquo;,” “put your feet up,” “drink a glass of wine,” “watch a sunset,” “schedule a massage (if Covid allows).” I recommend and enjoy all those things! They are relaxing, which is delightful. But they are not renewing, necessarily.</p>
<p>Renewing our energy is different from relaxing. It is different from only resting. When we rest, we renew a bit. Enjoying an evening watching TV may be restful but not renewing. It doesn&rsquo;t plant energetic seeds we can harvest later. We can renew without fully resting, doing a renewing activity in a hurry, for example. But we&rsquo;ll get the most benefit from doing both at the same time.</p>
<p>When we rest <em>and</em> renew, we gather ourselves, remove inner stuck spots, settle down our thinking and striving, reconstruct our inner integrity, and reengage our self-directed mastery (which settles us down).</p>
<p>“Work hard; play hard” is not renewing. We try to balance our doing (leaning in), with undoing (kicking back). TGIF! “Play hard” usually involves activities that leave us more drained, like drinking, overeating, gambling, etc. Again, those aren&rsquo;t necessarily <em>bad</em> things to enjoy, they are simply not restful or renewing.</p>
<p>Side rant: Yoga and meditation are often blithely recommended for relaxation and stress relief. Both, when done mindfully, usually make us feel <em>more</em> stressed, at least at first. Rather than avoiding our feelings and numbing our discomforts, we become aware of them. Mindful practices shine a light on our discomforts and for awhile, leave us feeling uncomfortable. That&rsquo;s a good thing. While I recommend body practices and encourage meditation, I do so in support of unblocking our energy, increasing self awareness, rather than as a quick trip to “la-la-land.”</p>
<h3 id="stimulate">Stimulate</h3>
<p>What is the “spark” that can lead to renewal? There are as many sparks as there are people. A spark is an activity that you enjoy <em>for its own sake</em>. Not for the reward, not for the pleasure it brings (though that&rsquo;s nice) but for the focus and renewal you experience.</p>
<p>What is something you pay deep attention to, that requires comfortable skill while nudging you outside your comfort zone? What activity allows the world to fall away as your energy becomes more focused?</p>
<p>Some of my sparks are reading, writing (like this article), backpacking, studying in a library, some types of crafts, some types of game playing, building things, coding, thinking, modeling and whiteboarding.</p>
<p>Two people can be doing the same activity, cooking dinner for example, and only one has sparked some energy. The person who is cooking for the experience of cooking, deeply engaged in the sensations of food and creatively transforming it. The other is getting dinner on the table, simply doing a chore. (Side note: interestingly, the primary difference between the two is the chosen context: “cooking for the experience of cooking” vs. “doing a chore.”)</p>
<p>What activity creates it&rsquo;s own sustainable energy once you&rsquo;re into it?</p>
<p>Sometimes, our work is renewing. That&rsquo;s the ideal, yes? As I&rsquo;ve embraced these principles, my work day includes more rest and renewal because I design my day to include tasks that are intrinsically satisfying. This isn&rsquo;t usual though. Even when I can work deeply, I find I need other types of rest and renewal outside of work. We can mix and match methods of sparking energy, depending on circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="remove-blockers">Remove blockers</h3>
<p>Usually, we aren&rsquo;t drained because we give too much energy away. We are drained because we are constantly restricting our natural energy flow in order to put time, energy and attention elsewhere. We ignore our bodies except to “work out.” We suppress our feelings and the urge towards energy-renewing activities. We rely on unhealthy habits to keep our energy artificially stimulated. This is exhausting, over time.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve stimulated renewing energy, we need to remove blockers to letting it flow. For me, Slack notifications and easy access to social media are big interrupters to flow. I don&rsquo;t keep my phone or other devices on me. Noise is another issue for me. I play background music (no words) so that normal house sounds don&rsquo;t distract me. I make myself comfortable &ndash; wear warm socks and get a blanket for my lap. I should keep water nearby because I get distracted by thirst, which leads to making tea which leads to wandering away &hellip; and, I often forget.</p>
<p>While we usually think we are blocked by “not enough time” or other distractions, we are more often blocked by our body. We move ourselves into repetitive postures (like sitting at a desk) but we never unwind ourselves from those postures. We are blocked by how our bodies contract when we are drained. When we try to focus, our discomfort tricks us into thinking we should go do something else. Move, distract. We&rsquo;re just experiencing blocked energy.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to go for a walk; think about the thing we are focusing on <em>while moving</em>. I get out of the chair, down on my woven rug to stretch when I get stuck. Or I stand at a whiteboard where I can put ideas in any shape I like, or I work at a standing desk.</p>
<p>Body practices like yoga or massage help make us aware of out stuck places, physically, but they need to be accompanied by the intention to work with them in our daily lives. Noticing how our bodies feel as we go through our day - “how deep is my breathing? - illuminates clues to which activities drain us and which renew us.</p>
<h3 id="channel">Channel</h3>
<p>Before Pema Chödrön became an internationally-known teacher and writer, she was a person trying and failing to focus her energy. Her teacher would say &ldquo;Relax and write.” She needed to let go of all the expectations and simply engage.</p>
<p>Rather than get all caught up in the myriad of things we could do and ideas we might chase, we need to channel our energy (in Pema&rsquo;s case, into a dharma talk). We need a container, banks along the side of the river so we can flow down it. And, ideally, we need to let ourselves be easeful while on that river.</p>
<p>Our renewing energy flows into something, otherwise it will spew like an open fire hydrant. Or spin like eddies in a river. Our channel can be reading a book or any activity that has some reasonable shape at completion. [Robb comment: I feel like you could say more about what an “activity that has some reasonable shape at completion” looks like&hellip; a couple more examples, maybe?]</p>
<h2 id="practice-mastery">Practice mastery</h2>
<p>How do you prioritize what activities are most important to do? How do you set boundaries around the energy draining activities and create more space for energy renewal? We can decide to practice mastery: choosing activities that develop satisfying, matterful skills that require practice and surprise us as we go deeper into them. (This is why, for some, cooking can be a good choice. Or meditation or woodworking.)</p>
<p>In daily life, it is easy to get blown around by every wind. There is so much to do, say, fix, engage in, respond to, consider, satisfy, etc., etc., etc.. We want so many things. When our rest and renewal time includes some form of practicing mastery, whether a creative endeavor, a physical activity, or learning, we also practice settling our attention <em>on something we value</em>. We practice making tradeoffs between external pressures and internal focus. If we are consistent, we guide ourselves towards deeper, more renewing options.</p>
<p>While practicing, <em>we</em> decide what matters, what is “enough.” We decide whether to use more blue or green, more adverbs, fewer adjectives, whether to throw underhand, and so on.</p>
<p>This grounding in our own decision-making process helps keep our attention focused on our own intentions. Then, when we are in the midst of a chaotic work situation, we are more likely to hear that voice of discernment. We get less caught up in the drama and stay more connected to what matters to us.</p>
<h3 id="staying-grounded-in-what-matters">Staying grounded in what matters</h3>
<p>Another exhausting pattern in our lives is pouring energy into things that don&rsquo;t matter to us. We have good reasons for doing this and, to some extent, it is inevitable. Changing our point of view is one solution. Sometimes we aren’t treating things that matter — like cooking, example — as if they matter. Nourishment is attention as well as activity. Paying attention makes everything more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Regardless of the strength of our mission and values, we are offered nearly-infinite opportunities to become confused about what matters. We do things for money or attention (which are often the same thing), even though we don’t value doing things simply for money or attention. We value doing an activity because it has meaning and purpose. Yet, we have mortgages to pay, children to feed, clothing to wear in winter. And we live in economies that trade, predominantly, on money and attention. “Mission-driven” and “values based” is a nice-to-have.</p>
<p>If we hope to make a difference in the world through activities that matter to us, we need to stay grounded in what matters to us. Which, given the power of the world&rsquo;s distracting pull, is incredibly difficult. Resting, renewing, and practicing mastery all help us choose — when the mind is dizzy with choices — the ones that matter most. Not all the time. Perhaps not most of the time. But sometimes. And sometimes is probably good enough.</p>
<h3 id="right-here-right-now-matters">Right here, right now, matters</h3>
<p>When we aren’t sure what matters, we can fall into this moment, this task, right here, right now. Resting and renewing depends on our ability to be right here — in this space time. This is extremely difficult for most of us. The simple practice of noticing your breathing, feeling your feet on the ground, or paying attention to your hands as they do a task (again and again) opens the floodgates on our ability to stimulate energy, unblock it and channel it towards matterful activities we hope to master.</p>
<h2 id="strengthening-inner-integrity">Strengthening inner integrity</h2>
<p>“We tend to run our whole life trying to avoid all that hurts or displeases us, noticing the objects, people, or situations that we think will give us pain or pleasure, avoiding one and pursuing the other.” ― Charlotte Joko Beck, Everyday Zen: Love and Work</p>
<p>We need rest from the  endless cycle of feeling we are not enough, not good enough, didn’t do enough, don’t have enough. The world around us is designed to keep us chasing the fake rabbit around the track. To seek comfort and avoid discomfort. Resisting this cultural gravity can sometimes be even more exhausting than running with it.</p>
<p>Many of us feel a constant tug to prove ourselves, to achieve. We experience this urge as life-and-death. In some ways, it is. Our work feeds us, literally. When is the effort chasing our own tails, an empty activity that uses up energy and never leads to satisfaction or satiation? [Robb edit: I have trouble parsing the previous sentence. I think you&rsquo;re saying: &ldquo;When is &lsquo;achieving&rsquo; or &lsquo;striving&rsquo; merely chasing our own tails — an empty activity that uses-up energy and never leads to satisfaction or satiation?&rdquo; Is that correct?] Replacing achievement-seeking with practicing mastery helps us let go of chasing the rabbit and instead, enjoy running.</p>
<h3 id="respond-instead-of-react">Respond instead of react</h3>
<p>Our greatest skill is learning to respond instead of react. The ability to stay reasonably aware of ourselves, our feelings and our experiences while making choices about where to invest our time, energy and attention. When something happens outside of us, a demand is made on our time for example, we need space to know how to respond. We need the inner integrity to prioritize what matters and to stay grounded. It’s a dance, a balance, a practice. A practice of <em>responding</em> to circumstances rather than <em>reacting</em> to them. Responding creates more space for rest and renewal; like swimming, a rhythmic movement that requires energy yet simultaneously renews energy.</p>
<p>Reacting is like being dragged out with every tide.</p>
<p>The quality of my life and my work depend on my ability to rest and renew. Learning this has taken decades. And I will likely be learning it (again) for the rest of my life. The payoff for me is this: when people work together in ways that respect these principles &hellip; they are <em>significantly</em> more successful and impactful. And enjoyable. The secret to creating elite teams of people who can do business-valuable things isn&rsquo;t to make them chase the rabbit faster. It’s to encourage (and practice) constantly resting and renewing — and trusting the strength of their powerful urge to run.</p>

<p>Wisdom crafters are seekers of a philosophic sunrise. They work hard, often in the shadows, to discover insights that change our view of things. Sometimes gently. Sometimes like a bolt of lighting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Wisdom crafters are Sunflower people. They seek emerging ideas, facing towards the philosophical sunrise. They are creators, working hard, often in the shadows, to discover insights that change our view of things. Sometimes gently. Sometimes like a bolt of lighting.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters read and when they read, they create connections in their minds between what is being considered and all the things one might also consider. It&rsquo;s difficult, consuming, but wisdom crafters can&rsquo;t help doing it. They need your joyful support to continue.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters speak their minds and suffer (greatly) when they are confused. So, they constantly endeavor to understand themselves better - their motivations, their conditioned reasoning. They fumble around in darkness until they can shine a light on their own blindspot.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters become whatever they set out to become, eventually. Which is difficult to do. Not because becoming is a hard thing (though it can be). But because the path is extremely difficult to see, know and trust. Voices shout. Don&rsquo;t look there! Is this who you most want to become now? Is this meaningful? Valuable? True?</p>
<p>Who are you to control your own destiny?</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters think about thinking. Wisdom crafters talk about thoughts.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters enjoy life deeply and sometimes (often?) they try to hide that fact. Others have embarrassed them for being &ldquo;too sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;melodramatic&rdquo; or for preferring natural beauty to things we are supposed to want (like Walmart, fast food and beer.)</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters value one thing above all else: truth. A thing must be considered, have substance and soundness before it is accepted. Once something is accepted, wisdom crafters play with it, turn it over and look at it from all the angles.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters thrive in solitude. Focused attention is sun, water and nourishment for their soil. They blossom when given an afternoon on their own. They may not know what to do with it because there are a great many possibilities. Time itself can feel overwhelming, in a good way, usually.</p>
<p>They might be shy; they are often bold. They can&rsquo;t help but speak up. This does not mean they are thick skinned. They suffer the arrows of derision like everyone else does. Many are slung at them.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters drive their own bus. They feel frightened and off kilter when they&rsquo;ve relinquished their reasoned navigation to other&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s &ldquo;leadership&rdquo;. They relinquish to get safety or security but that never works out for long. They prefer to leave the bus and walk, even if others call them crazy, until they can drive along the best right path for themselves again.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters practice self awareness, they journal or meditate or anything that enables them to &ldquo;see&rdquo; deeply, know strongly and grow their intuitive power.</p>
<p>Wisdom crafters must often wait decades before they know they are wisdom crafters. Once they know though, they discover true joy.</p>

<p>In the midst of the pandemic, during a retreat, I take a breath. When I stop constantly swimming towards more, I discover enough.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last month, I participated in an online women&rsquo;s meditation retreat. The <a href="https://www.dharma.org/retreats/552">original retreat, with teachers I first met 25 years ago</a>, was (of course) cancelled. A simpler version was offered via Zoom instead. I&rsquo;m not sure what I expected but whatever my expectations were, they were a dim version of reality. The retreat was a life preserver floating by while I&rsquo;m dog paddling on a stormy sea. I didn&rsquo;t realize I was in the water, over my head, trying desperately to stay busy and distracted, until I grabbed hold and caught my breath.</p>
<p>Some of us had already been hospitalized with the virus. One of us anticipated the death of her husband, who was in ICU. &ldquo;How do you plan for this when no one can come help you?&rdquo; she asked. Two of our mothers died. Some of us were alone. Some, if not most of us (myself included) were terrified of impending, doomladen economic realities. &ldquo;How do you make wise decisions when we can&rsquo;t know what will happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each time we gathered, I cried. I felt it in my body: reality. I gathered myself, facing the challenges in the midst of this. We used that phrase often, &ldquo;in the midst of this&rdquo;, and we rested in it.</p>
<p>I am still resting in it.</p>
<p>After the retreat, in the midst of this, I took my April vacation by moving into our travel trailer, parked in the driveway. I wrote and read and ate hotdogs cooked on sticks over the backyard firepit. I slept for the first time in forever. And I haven&rsquo;t slept as well since.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, I sometimes feel guilty for having enough supplies and enough cash to pay the mortgage. I feel guilty, rather than grateful, for enough food, enough meaningful work to do, enough love and support from friends pinging to ask me WTF is going on in New York? (It was grim. Now, it&rsquo;s less so.)</p>
<p>In the midst of this, I feel less alone than I did before, to be honest, because people are connecting authentically. Even in meetings that are usually sterile. I wish we could always connected that way (without all the suffering).</p>
<p>In the midst of this, I&rsquo;m terrified of what happens next, of the looming recession and all the uncertainty. Sometimes. Other times, I&rsquo;m not worried at all and trust it&rsquo;ll work out. I&rsquo;m taking a course this month with one of the teachers from the retreat. She says &ldquo;rest in not knowing.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m trying that.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, I am reading nonfiction and fiction simultaneously. I need the wisdom from reality and the steadiness from story. I look at news and yell &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; at the New York Times. The incredibly angryhardupsettingmeanscreaming headlines spill out only doom like so much honey to attract bees. The news may be occasionally necessary but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t help or nourish. A quick scan and I&rsquo;m drowning again in the sea of &ldquo;its all over.&rdquo; Also, the NYT&rsquo;s <em>constantly</em> highlights Trump. Can&rsquo;t we ignore him like real New Yorkers?</p>
<p>In the midst of this, I am taking a bath everyday, with a book and sometimes my husband, the dogs lying on the floor next to us. Breathing, resting, renewing, centering &hellip; everything is okay in the bathtub.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, I am in my yard, experiencing how all things are related. I am surrounded by Life. While the human engine of dominion is quiet, I feel part of the world herself again, including the sorrow. I feel part of my life. I feel part of my home.</p>
<p>If ever there was a time to dive deeply into understanding the joyfulness of enough, it is now, in the midst of this pandemic. Precious resources, like food and friends, matter more than anything. Books and mowing the lawn and chicks growing their feathers are the full roster of entertainment. There is nowhere to go and nothing else to do.</p>
<p>I want the world&rsquo;s suffering to end; I want everyone to be well and have resources. I am no longer waiting for the pandemic to end so that I can have more.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, I&rsquo;ve discovered that I already had enough. And I am grateful for it.</p>

<p>I wanted to live a Year of Enough. Now, I live in a pandemic epicenter where there is no more. Ironic, don’t you think? Inside all the uncertainty, I’m discovering the seeds of enough.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is 9:10 am Eastern Standard Time here in my  study. I&rsquo;m typing on my macbook pro with the sticky left shift key, while reclining in my overstuffed, brown, worn, leather chair. The view out of my window is full of blue morning March sky, still-bare trees and patchy spring grass. My fuzzy sherpa lap blanket will soon make me feel too warm.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Birds and frogs are chirping, the quiet of February steadily filling with noisy arrivals, like spring breakers. I can&rsquo;t hear them through my headphones, my Focus@Will timer playing ambient music for 40 minutes. When the timer goes off, I will iron my wrinkled shirt and curl my wrinkled hair before my 10:00 am video meeting.</p>
<p>I feel sad and scared. Do you? The coronavirus has gone from far away news snippets to a clear and present danger. I&rsquo;m tired of the word &ldquo;coronavirus&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m exhausted by the headlines. I am writing this to you because the only thing that has felt good and right lately is how people are talking more honestly, sincerely, and openly now. I work in technology, where feelings and authentic talk is usually verbotten. Even my twitter exchanges have been more meaningful. We are making ourselves visible inside our disconnected, disconcerting new normal.</p>
<p>So here I am, just talking and hoping that helps.</p>
<p>My husband, two dogs, two cats, two rats and ferret are weathering the storm here in the Hudson Valley, 90 minutes north of NYC. Next week, we&rsquo;ll add six chicks to our household. We have plenty of food in the fridge, having ventured out to Adams Fairacre Farms a few days ago. We didn&rsquo;t need to stock up on much though. Twoish years ago, when layoffs were pre-announced at the company we both worked for, we built wooden shelves in the basement and stocked up on items we use regularly. Our financial situation stabilized by the middle of last year, so we bought things when we ran out rather than bring them up from the basement. Thus is why we have plenty of toilet paper.</p>
<p>Side note: Has no one ever gone backpacking? In an emergency, is toilet paper the life saving item one wants on hand?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say about what is happening in the world. Does anyone really? Nothing I&rsquo;ve said, adding to the giant flood of information spewing from everywhere, has felt meaningful, valuable, matterful. It&rsquo;s tough, isn&rsquo;t it, to know how to feel? I&rsquo;m angry right now and I have no idea why. I can suddenly be consumed by it. I&rsquo;ve also been unbearably sad, each news item full of so much heartbreak and loss. Yesterday the news was Powells bookstore, which is a church, a shrine, holy ground. The store has closed and everyone is laid off and who knows what will happen. Powell&rsquo;s is a metaphor for so much isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Who know what will happen?</p>
<p>I am not a fan of uncertainty. Is anyone? Ironically, uncertainty is my profession. I architect technology decisions, the best possible solution under the circumstances, when the circumstances and outcomes are uncertain. Circumstances and outcomes are <em>always</em> uncertain, I say. We never really know. We must make our best choices anyway. I give talks about strengthening our ability to act without needing to make everything &lsquo;concrete&rsquo; first. Instead, I say, establish good patterns and trust they will flourish into good, if unexpected, systems that nourish us.</p>
<p>Yet, here I am, drowning in uncertainty. I&rsquo;m in the water with everyone else, our ship sinking. I hope we can swim. I hope sharks aren&rsquo;t nearby. I hope we aren&rsquo;t in the water too long.</p>
<p>That metaphor, drowning, feels apt 23.5 hours a day. During the other 30 minutes though, I feel free. As if the ship was a slave ship powered by meaningless human consumption. Products replacing food. Amazon wharehouses replacing local stores. iPhones replacing books. I had a feeling yesterday of being &ldquo;nearly done&rdquo; with stuff I had to do. I haven&rsquo;t had that feeling <em>in years</em>.</p>
<p>We rely on systems that, frankly, don&rsquo;t give a fuck about our well being. Or the planet&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ve been cruising on ships constantly seeking &ldquo;new worlds&rdquo; and &ldquo;more stuff&rdquo; while missing all the boats going to safer harbors like loving kindness, self worth, joy, enough, nourishment, satisfaction, contentment and renewal.</p>
<p>The mornings are my safe harbor. Yesterday, I got up at 3am. Today, I slept until 5:30 then went downstairs to make coffee in a French Press because our Bialeti isn&rsquo;t working right, despite my replacing the seal. I warm Silk soy creamer in our spinny creamer warmer. While the coffee brews, I put the dryer on dewrinkle, fluffing the duvet covers that have lingered in there for three days. I open the fridge and pull out bits of cheese, kale and homemade almond crackers for my pet rats. I add  MCT oil to my coffee cup because I need brain food.</p>
<p>All the while, through my usual routine, there is a persistent, nebulous anger. Thoughts rushing in my brain about past betrayals and abandonments. My irritated mind feeding my body the message that something is very wrong. Even though I&rsquo;m simply making coffee.</p>
<p>I take my cup, as I always do, upstairs into my study and write in my journal for an hour. I write with favorite fountain pen, the one Neil Gamain recommended. I write at the top of the page, as I always do, the date, time, moon cycle, number of days left in various countdowns and the selected daily tarot card.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s was Reversed Emperor. Which can symbolize the abuse of power and authority. Or the end of overreaching, over presumptive male authority. I&rsquo;ll just leave that thought right here.</p>
<p>In my journal, I make lists, use writing prompts, create space for my strategic, intuitive and &ldquo;wiser&rdquo; mind to discuss options with my &ldquo;wordly&rdquo; self. I am meditating, in my way. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know if I could maintain any reasonable quality of life if I stopped journaling. That sounds dire and overly dramatic, so I want to delete it. But it&rsquo;s not entirely untrue, so it stays.</p>
<p>Today I wrote about the changes in the world: what seeds are being planted, what is sprouting, where are the tender but stable shoots, what is blooming, fading, compost? My answers were all about how we seek, share, consume and exchange information. My income relies on building the systems that exchange information, so this perhaps a bit self serving. But, I suspect, it is at least somewhat accurate.</p>
<p>I also wrote a letter from Goddess to myself, wondering what I would hear if I could hear a wiser voice than my own. She said (paraphrasing) that it&rsquo;s time to take full responsibility for living a deeply authentic life. She said &ldquo;this is life and death situation, not simply because we are living in viral times, but because we must choose.&rdquo; Choose to come home to ourselves, to what matters. We can take that journey together. We can look to ourselves more and the world less for happiness.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is only what I need to hear. I don&rsquo;t believe in a divine authority outside of my own consciousness. This is me talking to me, in a sense. I don&rsquo;t believe that my daily tarot card is external to me either. I <em>do</em> believe that inuition is essential to crafting a worldview that is wiser than than simply asking myself what I <em>think</em>. Or feel.</p>
<p>Regardless, perhaps this is good for you to hear too. That we do have some ability to steer our ship. We have no choice but to hunker down. We can choose to take stock of what we value most. And to build a world that resembles that value.</p>
<p>We can choose to discover what is (truly) enough.</p>

<p>In the midst of the pandemic, many colleagues are working while their kids are schooling at home. A few have asked, via social media, for strategies. Having homeschooled for ten years, I have some! Here they are.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I began homeschooling the day my son&rsquo;s second grade teacher called to say &ldquo;the whole class was kept in from recess today, with their heads down, because your son didn&rsquo;t finish his math work.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My son didn&rsquo;t sit silently at his desk and complete a single-digit addition worksheet,  2+6, 4+3 etc. Instead, he stared out the window, kicking his feet to the beat of an imaginary song.</p>
<p>That night, he was playing in the bath, singing the inchworm song. &ldquo;One and one is two. Two and two are four. &hellip; 16 and 16 are 32.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, who taught you that song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugs and continues making &ldquo;pew pew&rdquo; sounds, his tub toys in the heat of battle. &ldquo;32 and 32 are 64,&rdquo; he says, midsplash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on sweetie, how do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looks at me with a &ldquo;dumb question&rdquo; face. &ldquo;I just figured it out.&rdquo; Duh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetie, really &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;64 and 64 is 128.&rdquo; Pewpew.</p>
<p>I stop putting the towels away, staring.</p>
<p>He smirks, the submarine in his right hand paused mid attack (apparently, bathmarines can fly). &ldquo;128 and 128 is &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>I laugh and walk out of the bathroom, saying over my shoulder, &ldquo;haha, I&rsquo;ll give you five dollars if you figure that out &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three steps later, he shouts. &ldquo;256!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By age 9, he was taking college physics. He wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;having trouble in math&rdquo;. He was having trouble in school.</p>
<p>I tried to find support for our situation but there wasn&rsquo;t much. He was always working at multilevels, sometimes grade school work was right, other times, college texts. No school I found, public or private, was set up for that. So, I made things up as I went along. Other mothers on the journey supported me and those who&rsquo;d walked the road before.</p>
<p>I taught but I also studied with him. I went back to school myself, after taking him to his physics class and enjoying it, which began a STEM career in technology that I never would have imagined prior. But that&rsquo;s a story for another day.</p>
<p>What I learned during that decade, first and foremost, is that there is no one right way to educate anyone. Every kid, every person, is different. I have many thoughts about this subject, many of which are different from my thinking the day the call came. But here, in the midst of coronavirus, I want to focus on <em>strategies for working while also educating at home</em>.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary. Because [see above sentence about &ldquo;no one right way&rdquo;].</p>
<p>Here are the seven things I learned the hard way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Face it, right now. Early morning is the only time you can focus.</li>
<li>Do &ldquo;in seat&rdquo; work together in the same room</li>
<li>Become initiative driven rather than task driven</li>
<li>When it looks like nothing is happening , more is happening</li>
<li>Floppy fish is essential, don&rsquo;t interrupt it</li>
<li>Ask them to teach you how to do something</li>
<li>Stop early. (If you want to stay sane)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="get-up-stupid-early">Get up stupid early</h2>
<p>As soon as my son stopped taking naps (long before kindergarten), my focused work day fell apart. Oh, I hated that transition. I was at my writing desk the day the call came. I should have heard the giant crack in my creative foundation.</p>
<p>Over the years, I tried everything to write or study while he was awake. I failed. Only two things worked: doing focused work before he woke up or when he was elsewhere (like at a friend&rsquo;s house.)</p>
<p>Now, I am a morning person. And he is not. So that helped. But it meant that I was ready for bed by 8pm and he was not. So we had a rule, once he was old enough: you have to go to bed when I do. You do not have to sleep. You can read or (later) play gameboy. Color. Bring legos. But you must stay quiet in bed and you can&rsquo;t use the internet. This got us by until he was old enough to manage his own evenings.</p>
<h2 id="work-together">Work together</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t focus on my tasks when a part of my mind is monitoring whether or not someone else is doing their tasks somewhere else. It&rsquo;s maddening. Leaving the room was never a great strategy, his daydreaming approach to studying persisted. Plus, tasks are lonely, aren&rsquo;t they? Doing &ldquo;seat work&rdquo; is better together.</p>
<p>We often did our &ldquo;homework&rdquo; at the same table. I don&rsquo;t mean I helped him with his, though I would. I mean we both showed up with work to do. I think this developed better relational habits. Habits that translated to restaurants, airplanes &hellip; I&rsquo;ve even taught a yoga class with him nearby.</p>
<p>In fairness, he&rsquo;s inclined towards self entertainment and was more interested in his matchbox cars than being rowdy in public. So I got that for free. But even without that &hellip; modeling the behavoir you are looking for is, in my experience, far more effective than demanding it.</p>
<p>Side note: this also applies to reading together.</p>
<h2 id="create-projects">Create projects</h2>
<p>One thing I truly hate about traditional &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; is how it can suck all the joy out of things. Joy arises when we dive deeply into something. If you want your kids to self engage, you&rsquo;ll need to organize creative learning projects rather than assign them task work.</p>
<p>For example, I was struggling to keep my son&rsquo;s attention on his school work. He wanted to focus on Ancient Rome. He&rsquo;d become passionately interested, I can&rsquo;t remember how, in that subject. So I started pushing all other subjects into that theme. Language? Study Latin (had to hire a tutor cause I don&rsquo;t know Latin). Math? Roman numerals and other types of commerce and engineering skills. Art? Dioramas of Roman homes. Reading? Mythology. We ventured into areas I wouldn&rsquo;t have known to go. And I had no trouble demonstrating academic progress at the end.</p>
<p>I imagine that kids who are home temporarily because of the virus will have work assigned. Cool. But what about the rest of the day? What would they love to explore? Can they be set up to explore it on their own?</p>
<h2 id="trust-learning-to-emerge">Trust learning to emerge</h2>
<p>At the end of each year, I had to prove to the state that my son had learned sufficient stuff. (These rules vary by state in the US.) One year, I was struggling to put together a package of proof and concerned because in some areas, like English, we hadn&rsquo;t made as much progress as I&rsquo;d planned. I was also behind in grading his math work because by then, he was better than me in math so it took me longer, even with the teacher&rsquo;s edition.</p>
<p>I decided to take us on a train trip to Glacier National Park. We&rsquo;d wrap up our year&rsquo;s work on the journey and then hike for a few days.</p>
<p>Side note: my son never enjoyed hiking, ruining all illusion that you can expose your kids to things and they will automagically like them.</p>
<p>On the train, we talked about his new obsession, MUDding (digital, text-based fantasy games). MUDs were also my new obsession but we only sometimes played together. As we talked, I realized that he had written reams of fantasy and science fiction over the last six months as part of his play. He&rsquo;d read about 20 books, for fun. If my English &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; had been character development, plot, story, theme etc &hellip; he&rsquo;d have done far more work than a usual course would require. So, I changed my curriculum, gathered his work, and included it in the package.</p>
<p>I also gave him his math work to grade while I did so. He was better at that too, explaining to me where and why he&rsquo;d made mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="dont-interrupt-creative-discomfort">Don&rsquo;t interrupt creative discomfort</h2>
<p>As people settle into creative play, they become uncomfortable. We flop around like fish in the bottom of a boat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t waaaaannnnaaa go outside&rdquo;, we say. Then, we don&rsquo;t want to come back in when the sun goes down because we&rsquo;ve built a fort and are busy hanging out with the faeries.</p>
<p>Three mistakes are common and crucial to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Do not fix this discomfort</em> by taking it (too) seriously. Let them flop around and complain they are bored. Be careful about recommending things, my son would explicitly NOT do something just because I suggested it. Give them some time to find their own fun.</li>
<li><em>Do not let them turn on the television</em> (or any other distraction) to avoid the floppiness. We didn&rsquo;t own a TV, which solved that challenge. But we did own computers and we were on them a lot, which is the same thing when a distraction is sought. Ensure there is time when it&rsquo;s all off.</li>
<li><em>Do not give them sugar</em>. (White flour foods is also sugar.) Well, go ahead, give them sugar, that&rsquo;s the best way to ensure you never want to do so again. Floppy time isn&rsquo;t a time for revving up, it&rsquo;s a time for finding flow. Real food won&rsquo;t artificially distract from the creative discomfort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ask-them-to-teach-you">Ask them to teach you</h2>
<p>One of my favorite ways to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; my son into learning was to ask him to teach me how to do something. Almost everyone loves to demonstrate expertise. By the time he was six, I would bring home a new appliance and leave the box unopened. He&rsquo;d set it up, read the manual and show me how to use it. When I bought my first new car, he was 11. He took the manual to bed with him and the next day, walked me through the features.</p>
<p>Other parents have told me stories about kids baking bread and teaching them about different approaches, taking apart a radio and explaining how it works, building a rabbit coop, figuring out vacation options. The goal of &ldquo;knowing something&rdquo; is often far more appealing than the goal of learning something.</p>
<h2 id="stop-work-early-if-you-can">Stop work early, if you can</h2>
<p>5pm is the absolute worst time of day, in my experience. 6pm, if we were still trying to &ldquo;get things done&rdquo;, even worse. There&rsquo;s a reason why Thoreau went for a walk every afternoon. There is only so much sustained energy we can put into a day before we need to pause, go outside, do something with our hands, read a book &hellip; settle into something other than grinding out what &ldquo;needs&rdquo; to get done.</p>
<p>Especially when kids are in the mix. My son is an adult now, an adult who owns his own home and pings me funny Imgur links in Slack during the work day. Yet my evenings are still difficult if I&rsquo;ve worked too long without a &ldquo;play&rdquo; break.</p>
<p>If at all possible, during this time of isolation, try to find the magic hidden in the late afternoons. It&rsquo;s there. When we miss it, we never really renew our energy.</p>
<p>And I imagine you need all the energy you can muster right now. I&rsquo;m with you in spirit.</p>

<p>It has been three weeks since I posted. In part because some difficult work consumed my writing energy. But mostly, because I ran smack into something I didn’t want to say out loud.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am back in my study after a week in Amsterdam. I gave a talk at a <a href="https://dddeurope.com/2020/">conference</a>, which may sound commonplace but the experience was uncommon for me. The preparation work and the trip itself were a rare opportunity to be (mostly) myself. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->People presume that I am always myself because I seem authentic (mostly I am) and honest (I am). But the truth is, I rarely express my thinking the way that I think it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t want to say: When I was 19, I was &ldquo;diagnosed&rdquo; as profoundly gifted. (Which means, I tested off the scale of their measurement tool.) At the time, I had no conceptual understanding of what that meant. The man assessing me, a PhD at the university I attended, said it meant that I &ldquo;could be doing anything&rdquo; and was failing to live up to my potential because I was lazy and &ldquo;lacking perseverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(If you know me personally, you are probably making a &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; face. Lack of efforting is not my challenge.)</p>
<p>What I knew was that I felt alone, in ways I could not understand or articulate. And that my aloneness was my fault, I was broken somehow (always) and that was why I was rejected or humiliated or confused or failing really awful courses. Nothing was failing me, of course. Especially not the assessment man.</p>
<p>I was confused by the reactions I engendered because I was simply me. I thought everyone was like me. So, I must be broken. That&rsquo;s what people said, in a million subtle ways. &ldquo;Too much.&rdquo; Differences were usually summed up as too much or not enough of [something] on my part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody thinks like you, Diana.&rdquo; &lt;&ndash; this was not a compliment.</p>
<p>I know now, because I&rsquo;ve read a book about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraca_Gross">Dr. Miraca Gross</a>&rsquo;s long term study, that my experiences were perfectly normal, when compared to other kids like me. The social isolation and loneliness, the bullying and slut shaming (teenagers' ultimate weapon against those who are different), the pathological boredom and under perfomance that is called everything but boredom. The intensities and sensitivities. The worst part, for me, was that any suggestion that I suffered because I was &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, was dismissed as arrogant and deluded. Reality was that I was a pile of low self esteem blended with high self awareness.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s response to the test result was, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why you quit everything and are constantly messing up your life.&rdquo; The result gave her a label for my unsatisfactoriness. (Notice I have not said that I am profoundly gifted, only that I was diagnosed as such. Can&rsquo;t seem to do that yet.)</p>
<p>There exists a misunderstanding that &ldquo;giftedness&rdquo; is an enhancement. That I can understand everything other people do plus some extra. I&rsquo;m a bit quicker (I am, sometimes). I memorize better (I don&rsquo;t) and would do well on Jeopardy (I wouldn&rsquo;t). That I&rsquo;m better at school or an ideal candidate for management (I&rsquo;m not). That I&rsquo;m simply more RAM.</p>
<p>None of these are necessarily the case. It is more right to say that I am Alice and the world is Wonderland. Where people wonder why I <em>choose</em> to be out of place. Intelligence might be described on a linear continuum as a &ldquo;score&rdquo; but it is more a 3D measure of intensity. If you ask someone who knows me &ldquo;is she smarter than you&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d get a variety of answers. If you ask &ldquo;is she more intense than you&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m fairly sure everyone would say yes.</p>
<p>I am confused by what makes perfect sense to other people. I am often &ldquo;too much&rdquo; of something or other. I am devoted to people I love even as it might seem like I don&rsquo;t pay attention. I ask a lot of questions, which is the understatement of this post. <em>Many</em> things matter deeply to me, things that do not seem to matter to other people. Or, rather, too many things matter at the same time.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a judgement, that things should matter, I don&rsquo;t feel more moral. Yet people find this irritating. I am bizarrely intuitive (my husband calls it my spidey sense.) I talk a lot, even though I am an introvert. I talk about concepts mostly and others presume I do that on purpose, rather than it simply being how I think. Most people tolerate my conceptual talking but only a rare few welcome it. My hairdresser says  I am the only client who tells her the circumstances in which my hair will be expressing itself. I said &ldquo;why would I tell you specifically how to cut my hair? I don&rsquo;t know how to cut hair.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s one of the rare ones.</p>
<p>As a kid in school, the pressure to hide my passion for learning was physical, in the form of bullying, once so extreme I switched public schools. I was told that I didn&rsquo;t deserve to go to private school and that I was &ldquo;just going to grow up and get married&rdquo; so not worth the money. I was told that I only wanted a PhD so I can &ldquo;have a nameplate on my desk&rdquo;. (So I didn&rsquo;t get one.) I &ldquo;need to live in the real world&rdquo;. I &ldquo;think too much.&rdquo; Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been ousted, in a few still-painful ways, despite bringing trustworthy and, I think, valuable change. I feel the rejection yet dismiss this fact: lack of real relationship to truth, suffering, wisdom seeking and pattern awareness, so common in school and organizations, drives me mad.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that this is an &ldquo;issue&rdquo; only if I talk about it or make it an &ldquo;issue&rdquo;. &ldquo;Everyone is smart in their own way.&rdquo; Huh. People have historically not empathized or understood so I don&rsquo;t say this out loud. To be honest, I can&rsquo;t tolerate more not being understood.</p>
<p>People are still sometimes uncomfortable with my intensity and to some extent, I understand. Yet, nobody has ever asked <em>me</em> what it&rsquo;s like to be around people who <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> intense. What would I need in order to feel comfortable?</p>
<p>The burden is on me to be normal. Which, trust me when I say this, is something I&rsquo;ve worked extremely hard at &hellip; with limited success. Normal isn&rsquo;t bad (I would love to feel like I fit) but its incredibly hard work that doesn&rsquo;t energize me or fill me with a feeling of &ldquo;today was enough.&rdquo; Like acting straight when you are gay because people have convinced you that who you are hurts them somehow.</p>
<p>Since I was 19, I have been &ldquo;diagnosed&rdquo; multiple times and told, multiple times, that my burdens will be lighter when I accept myself as I am. <em>That I am enough.</em> The self hate goes deep but I had help putting it there. Fortunately, I also have help replacing it with self love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived this experience twice over. My son is also &ldquo;diagnosed&rdquo; and I homeschooled him when school refused any accommodations. His story, and mine, are so common among exceptionally/profoundly gifted people that we are a trope. Yet, there was almost no support for this. Many people, some close, rejected my addressing his situation because it &ldquo;treated him like he was special&rdquo;. Nobody says that about other special needs kids, do they?</p>
<p>Anyway, I have not published this (Froze!) because I feel ashamed to admit it and triply ashamed when the admission is dismissed as arrogance or delusion. I don&rsquo;t feel more than, I feel different from. More left out than superior. I am almost always, honestly, trying to do good things for people.</p>
<p>As I dived into my Year of Enough, I was simultaneously asking myself the questions I wish I&rsquo;d asked myself decades ago. Instead, I&rsquo;ve stayed drunk on codependency. Investing decades in relationships with men who had issues of their own and re-ording my life constantly to prioritize them. To make myself right sized, whatever that meant at the time. I have also made some really, truly terrible life choices while trying to find something that felt right. Hurt people, foolishly, while seeking safety, whatever that is. Without, simultaneously, making space for my whole self.</p>
<p>I am, thank the goddess, done with all that.</p>
<p>What is satisfying, energizing and joyful to study, write about, engage in, do, build, create, think about? When do I feel like there is enough meaningful work to do in a day? What is meaningful work? How do I listen to my needs and allow others to see and know me as I am? What do <em>I</em> need in order to feel safe and comfortable in social situations? What accommodations actually help me to feel part of the world? Who are my true allies?</p>
<p>Turns out, I have many true allies. Working in technology has brought me some wonderful colleagues and friends. (And my husband.) While I was hiding from writing this post, the people close to me have encouraged me. My beloved Swiss friend said &ldquo;You have no choice. You are smart. Be that.&rdquo; Bless her. Nobody has said anything derisive. While creating content for our business, I said to my colleagues, &ldquo;wow, huh, I write a lot of sentences that have big concepts behind them without always explaining those concepts.&rdquo; They were nodding so hard their heads bobbled. So, it&rsquo;s not like others who love me haven&rsquo;t noticed. They already know.</p>
<p>At the conference, Many people were like me. They talk and think and socialize similarly to the way I do. It was an adjustment; one I&rsquo;m happy to make. I also have online friends who get it.</p>
<p>What do I know about enough, now that I&rsquo;ve seen and accepted how &ldquo;in the closet&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve kept myself? What will increase my joyfullness? Here are some answers that have come so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing everyday for at least three hours</li>
<li>nourishing my need to study by letting myself revel in listening to audio books, reading in restaurants and watching talks during my lunch break</li>
<li>take &ldquo;listening to books&rdquo; drives and &ldquo;reading all day&rdquo; vacations</li>
<li>letting myself enjoy all the solitude I have and not be sorry about it, feeling like I should be answering email</li>
<li>trusting that my vivaciousness is part of me, a good part of me, and letting myself find spaces where I can constantly bubble (or at least, bubble more)</li>
<li>most essentially, knowing that I don&rsquo;t need anyone else&rsquo;s validation or approval or acceptance in order to be valid, valuable and self accepting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used self hate and control to organize my inner world. That sucks. I&rsquo;m going to give self love a try now. I&rsquo;ll let you know what I learn.</p>

<p>What I do is balanced and supported by all I don’t do. I’ve never been great at balance. Or taking deep breaths. Seems I’m learning both now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first draft of this post opened with &ldquo;while setting up Todoist and integrating it with all devices, I &hellip;&rdquo; Then I was struck by how that sounds. I was unironically setting up a crack den after realizing that I&rsquo;m a crack addict. (See previous posts.) Leveling up my crack accoutrements rather than, you know, going to rehab.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The enough lessons must be sinking in because I caught myself. This morning I was terrified to write. A few weeks from now, I&rsquo;m giving a talk at a conference of people I value and respect. The text of the talk is evolving into things I <em>really</em> want to say and includes insights I <em>truly</em> value. So, of course, I&rsquo;m scared to say those things. To risk that. And I&rsquo;m super scared I won&rsquo;t finish writing it, with slides, in time and it&rsquo;ll suck. I&rsquo;ll suck. You know how it is, the fear talking.</p>
<p>I <em>want</em> to say what I&rsquo;m planning to say. I hope others will find the talk valuable. But the truth is <em>I&rsquo;m</em> not the key factor here. Wisdom arises.  It emerges and finds its path like water; flows. Wise thinking isn&rsquo;t produced or created or generated or done, you can&rsquo;t sit down and make it like a summer camp popsicle stick basket. Wisdom isn&rsquo;t yours to share, you can only listen and integrate and write and get out of the way.</p>
<p>Most of what I say and think is not wise. I&rsquo;m also not a big Get Out of the Way gal. But I crave the experience of stumbling into knowing something valuable and transformative, an experience I don&rsquo;t get very often. I fail and fail when I try to articulate things but wisdom is always the goal. The sweetest most precious goal we can fail at, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I was afraid to write so instead, I made a list of other things I hoped todo today. Just to &ldquo;get them off my mind.&rdquo; I walked around the house with my notebook. At first, this helped. My day was organizing and prioritizing itself on paper.</p>
<p>Then, quickly, the list became overwhelming. I persevered, of course, adding everything I could think of and next thing I knew, I wasn&rsquo;t writing OR doing those things. I was sitting on the couch holding my notebook looking dazed and stuffed, like Thanksgiving. I hadn&rsquo;t even opened Todoist yet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Why do I do this to myself?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve been organizing my reading (past, present and future) in LibraryThing. Which.I.Love. I felt wonderfully relaxed this week once I set up my account, imported from Goodreads and began creating more lists. I felt energized. I&rsquo;ve been ordering books. This morning, I ordered five more titles that I&rsquo;m excited to read. Plus put a few on my Kobo. And added four audio books because I had credits.</p>
<p>Now, if you are a normal person, you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;when will she read all those books?&rdquo; If you are not a normal person, which is highly possible given that you are reading this post and therefore, probably know me, trust me when I say that question is reasonable to ask right now.</p>
<p>The answer is, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m reading five or six books at the moment plus feel pressure to read the five or six I <em>should</em> be reading while preparing for the talk. Sometimes, I don&rsquo;t remember which book I&rsquo;m reading when I sit down to read. So I strategically leave my books or kobo in spots, like next to the bathtub, to prompt myself. Some books are Car Rides Only. Overstory (omg its wonderful) was a beloved car companion for a couple months (I don&rsquo;t drive often) and I miss it now.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://www.corynakasue.com/">exercises with Cory</a> yesterday, I discovered that I only inhale and exhale as much as is necessary. I rarely finish an exhale and am not sure what &ldquo;inhale to your collar bones&rdquo; means. This is how I live my life. I bring in what I need but I rarely make sufficient space to fully enjoy it or to fully release when it&rsquo;s over. I love to cook. I avoid the dishes.</p>
<p>The contraction in my breathing and my ribcage that we are releasing is my fear of never having enough time, energy and attention to really, truly settle into learning, reading, doing, experiencing, thinking, creating, etc. I don&rsquo;t trust it. I don&rsquo;t trust life to nourish and support me doing it. I control my attention so I stay just shallow enough to Get Shit Done. To Be Who I&rsquo;m Supposed to Be. Something the world constantly rewards me for.</p>
<p>When we stop doing &ldquo;enough&rdquo; of what is rewarded or expected, we may put ourselves in economic and relational peril. The fear isn&rsquo;t simply in our minds. It is legitimately risky to let go and be authentic. Brene Brown is coaching the whole world on how to do this &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s that fricken hard. Buddhism has been teaching it for a bazillion years but Buddha was monastic so there&rsquo;s a limit to how much those teaching help us. We&rsquo;ve got to take risks and figure it out as we go and that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>The first time I noticed my pattern, I googled &ldquo;hoarding todos.&rdquo; No relevant results. But I&rsquo;m sure its a thing. I&rsquo;m constantly hoarding things to do or get or start or fix or change or WHATEVER to protect myself from being bored. I was pathologically bored as a kid and young adult. I can not tolerate how shallow and superficial many social transactions or experiences can feel. But, I thought, that was life. You must learn to deal with it, get by. I couldn&rsquo;t drown and I couldn&rsquo;t swim so I learned to grasp any complex, interesting or intractable mental challenges to keep me afloat. Keep them as close as I could, stacking them inside while externally doing things I was supposed to do.</p>
<p>I loved feeling full of impossible but maybe satisfying things to do. Until I couldn&rsquo;t fit anymore in. Things weren&rsquo;t leaving, being done, at the same rate I brought them in. Not by a long shot. My inner world became a dense black hole. Does a black hole have a maximum density? If so, I reached mine.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Well, my first practice is learning to take full breaths. I know this seems simple but is it? Not for me. Breathe and feel the ground supporting me, letting myself occupy space. Release, let go, be nourished. Ha! Oh, that sounds tritely easy but have you tried it? I&rsquo;m not a big fan of this work, I confess, but its good and right and I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>Second practice is to let myself trust that Enough Enjoyable Things to Do are out there and I can go find them, do them, any time. The metaphor that comes to mind is &ldquo;My collection of seashells can live on the beaches of the world.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t need to capture items on my lists, though I can, if that&rsquo;s fun, which it is, as long as I remember my lists are fiction. I don&rsquo;t need to stress about anything I don&rsquo;t do because if I didn&rsquo;t do it &hellip; I did not choose to do it. I get to choose.</p>
<p>I can read more yet feel happily surrounded by more than I can (or will) read. I can live in the middle of the world&rsquo;s library and that can be enough.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I can finish writing this (which is awesome because remember, I was afraid to write?!) then go do something renewing. Like play a game with my husband or go out to &hellip;. and the next three things I was about to write were Tasks dressed up like Renewing things. Man, I&rsquo;ve got a ways to go. Many tasks <em>are</em> renewing, but those cheeky buggers stack up and merge into Getting Shit Done before I know it.</p>
<p>My joyful rule today will be: Ground myself in being home and do only things that increase my inner energy level. Recharge my battery so I can continue doing scary but valuable things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know how that goes &hellip;</p>

<p>When I hoard todos and refuse to ask for help, I stifle the Enough Economy. A lesson I recently learned for the bazillionth time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This weekend, I hired a developer to finish coding our new website. That was difficult for me to do. I called it &ldquo;waving the white flag&rdquo; rather than what is actually was, which is &ldquo;what I should have done in the fricken first place.&rdquo; I honestly believe that I <em>should</em> do everything that I <em>can</em> do. Yes, I know, that&rsquo;s impossible. Truly. Yet, I am a blockhead and must relearn this lesson again and again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Meanwhile, my partners were relearning the same lesson. Robb hired a designer for his new podcast cover even though he <em>can</em> design himself. (We hadn&rsquo;t spoken first, a synchronous conclusion that screams &ldquo;right strategy&rdquo;.) While Dom was reviewing the developer&rsquo;s code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &ldquo;I wanted to casually mention that you are doing the review but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t do the review and only males can do it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dom: &ldquo;I get that, I would feel frustrated with that too, and that doesn’t even take into account the gender bias stuff.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &ldquo;But &hellip; isn&rsquo;t today more enjoyable and energizing than working on the site was?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dom: &ldquo;Yeah, definitely.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &ldquo;But, yet, we have all spent the last four months trying to do the work ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dom: &ldquo;Right, coz that’s the default choice and anything else is just admitting defeat or wasting money.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Important note: We have been playing orchestration and team leadership roles <em>for years</em>. And yet &hellip;</p>
<p>At home, same same. For a few years after buying the house, I struggled until I &ldquo;broke down&rdquo; and hired help with the housework. Or, I should say, hired us-but-mostly-him help with housework. He does more than I do. We&rsquo;d adopted two big dogs. We&rsquo;d fired the landscaping company and then discovered how much work it is to tend four acres. We&rsquo;d put off hiring someone to clean the gutters, a thing neither of us have ever done, until we&rsquo;d waded through the muddy runoff, or slipped on the ice field, for a year. The only help we&rsquo;d hired easily was the hornet exterminator. Those bastards are mean. The hornets, I mean.</p>
<p>I never, omg, ask directions. When I shop, I search <em>the entire store, eight times</em> before I ask for help. (This drives my son nuts.) I love the puzzle solving. And I&rsquo;m a blockhead.</p>
<p>Here is the sad, anti-enough byproduct of hoarding of todo items (I absolutely hoard todo items): I limit the Enough Economy.</p>
<p>While writing this post, I felt embarrassed because I <em>can</em> hire people to help me. During decades of my life, especially as a single mother, I did not have enough cash to do that. Now, I feel some shame admitting I do. I worry this is the White Lady Privilege post. Yapping about stuff that people can&rsquo;t afford.</p>
<p>But you know what? My reluctance serves no one. The truth is, having enough to share is supporting other women (and men) who are doing their thing and building their expertise. Their energy nourishes mine.</p>
<p>The don&rsquo;t-remember-how-we-lived-without-you <a href="http://mcguirescleaning.com/">housecleaning company</a> is local and woman owned. (They also did the gutters.) Our wonderful <a href="http://www.happytailsanimalcare.com/">pet sitter</a> and her team have helped our dog&rsquo;s difficult fear issues. So has <a href="http://countrycomfortanimalhospital.vetstreet.com/">our vet</a>, who he fears most. My <a href="https://www.waywardhairdresser.com/">hairdresser</a>, whose new salon is 2.5 hell-yes-I-travel-that-far hours away, keeps me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvAj1qhA60j/">fabulously dimensional</a>. Three women are transforming my life as they teach my body, <a href="http://www.corynakasue.com/">Cory Nakasue</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinNYC">Robin Arzón</a> and <a href="https://www.hudsonriveryoga.com/">Susannah Grange</a>, whose classes I&rsquo;ve been missing. I choose my doctor because she also advocates for eating real food as a medical necessity.</p>
<p>The developer I hired is a young woman in India, starting out her career. I can now provide opportunities to others that were provided to me, years back.</p>
<p>There are many more examples. We shop locally, investing as much as we can in our neighbor&rsquo;s work. We buy locally-grown food all season at the farmer&rsquo;s market. My life is made richer and more joyful by all of it.</p>
<p>Looking through this lens, I see that trying to do everything myself is primarily ego. Selfishness. Fear, oh so much fear, that I won&rsquo;t have enough. That I (personally) don&rsquo;t do enough. Why not let exchanges flow instead? Share enough. Replenish in the nourishment of others. Nourish others.</p>
<p>And remember that whatever I do is enough, even when it isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;everything&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don’t enjoy competition yet can be quite competitive. What’s that about? How is competition related to being enough?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve begun indoor cycling, joining digital spinning classes from home. Which has made me think about competition. My relationship to the leaderboard is complicated. I simultaneously don&rsquo;t care about &ldquo;winning&rdquo; and feel badly that I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;winning&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are listening to the NFL playoff games while doing crafty things on the weekends. My feelings about sportsball (as my techsnob friends call it) are complicated too.</p>
<p>American Football (so called because football is soccer in the rest of the world) destroys the players' body while pursuing wins. This seems exploitative to me, at best. Gymnasts suffer the same fate. I don&rsquo;t think competing is valuable enough to pay that price. Winning at sports makes me happy when my body is equally happy about playing.</p>
<p>Despite my critical detachment, when I watch, I get caught up in the emotional drama of fandom. When &ldquo;my team&rdquo; wins (my team is The Patriots, don&rsquo;t judge!), I act like I&rsquo;ve personally accomplished something &hellip; besides making chicken wings and yelling at the television. I mentally sort other fans into categories. Jets and Steelers fans are probably violent felons. Seahawks and Packers fans are kind people. Buffalo fans attend support groups with Mets fans. I am not immune.</p>
<p>Worklife is ramping up, as it does in January, and I&rsquo;m feeling professionally shy about competing. Which is problematic because as a business owner, competing is necessary. My cohorts and I are recreating our website to better demonstrate how we can help potential clients. I feel stuck. Positioning my team in a certain market enters us in a race for marketshare. I&rsquo;m uncomfortable doing that because I don&rsquo;t want to race, there&rsquo;s enough work to go around. At the same time, of course, we do have an area of specialization and we are very good at what we do. I want to &ldquo;win&rdquo; opportunities to do more awesome things. And, of course, to ensure that we have revenue to pay our mortgages.</p>
<p>Book magic, the arriving of a book at the exact moment I need to read it, brought me <a href="https://www.powells.com/book/-9780743226752"><em>The Power of Full Engagement</em></a> last week. The authors' experience demonstrates that extrinsic motivations (besting the competition) might make us stand out temporarily &hellip; but intrinsic motivations (living our values) makes us shine. I want to shine. I don&rsquo;t want to set myself on fire doing it, as I&rsquo;ve done in the past. Competing can be a constant chasing of fleeting experiences. We win; we start again. The pursuit is more exhausting than exhilarating, longterm.</p>
<p>I reject some of the common thinking about competition and &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; mindsets. For example, I&rsquo;m never interested in diminishing or subjugating or humiliating anyone else. Even if they are an a$$h0l3. (Okay, I have my moments, but generally speaking.) If that approach is what it takes to &ldquo;win&rdquo; &ndash; I&rsquo;m happy being a loser.</p>
<p>In the United States, many people believe, based on their voting, that this type of &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; approach is strength and necessary and good. As if it takes courage to shame tweet. Cheating, even treason, is acceptable if it means you win against your &ldquo;enemies&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In some arenas, perhaps this approach is necessary. Those arenas aren&rsquo;t really competitions. They are narcissism played out on the world stage. A show. And they never, ever end well for anyone in the long run.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t enjoy most forms of competition yet I am definitely competitive. Which is confusing. I have little faith in hierarchy yet play leadership roles. I <em>love</em> being selected for speaking engagements or new professional opportunities. I use those opportunities to create opportunities for others. I am a WE person. My mantra is &ldquo;when the team succeeds, the team succeeds. When the team fails, I fail.&rdquo; Yet I love, as much as anyone, my moments of being the star.</p>
<p>Everybody, all together, from the beginning is a tenant of my work. But the goal is not to be normal. I work very hard with teams to ensure they can absolutely, positively kick ass. My passion for this is lifelong. At ten, I was drum major of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on3JHBNggLk">Drum and Bugle Corp</a>. The first time I saw a competition, I was hooked. Drum corps was the perfect balance of integrative leadership and personal excellence. Striving for excellence alone matters; striving for excellence together matters more.</p>
<p>Competitions I wouldn&rsquo;t want to win:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popularity contests</li>
<li>Beauty pageants</li>
<li>Anything shown on reality tv (which is hardly reality)</li>
</ul>
<p>Competitive prizes I would want to win:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobel</li>
<li>Tony</li>
<li>Pulitzer</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I want to win a cycling race? Not really. Which doesn&rsquo;t stop me from trying and crying. What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my Gold Medal ideal: My ideas and recommendations win influence when my thinking is strategically sound. (I hate losing to an unsound idea.) I cross the finish line when I create strategically sound experiences, at home and in my work.</p>
<p>When I share insights that are meaningful and valuable to others, I win attention and trust. I train for those Olympics. Yet, I feel shy about saying so.</p>
<p>How is competition related to enough? I think the key is knowing when you are competing because you feel like &ldquo;less&rdquo; and when you are striving for your own brand of excellence. To each her own. Our light does not diminish others. We can shine and compete for the space to sparkle. We don&rsquo;t need, meanwhile, to engage in competitions that don&rsquo;t have meaning (for us). We can, in those cases, be the cheerleaders for others.</p>
<p>Go cycling companions! Go Titans, who beat the Patriots in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Go, all ye who want to avoid cleaning up after narcissism wins &hellip; and vote.</p>

<p>I recently made almond milk. It was so easy, I wondered if there are other products I buy that I don’t need. Which made me wonder why I love ‘products’ (instead of food) in the first place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each week, we buy unsweetened <a href="https://www.califiafarms.com/collections/plant-milks">almond milk</a> at the grocery store. Recently, I read a new <a href="https://www.powells.com/book/-9781579658021">cookbook</a> (highly recommended) that includes a recipe for nut milk. So I tried making it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The process was:</p>
<ul>
<li>soak almonds in water</li>
<li>throw them in a blender with more water</li>
<li>strain them through cheesecloth</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Voila, almond milk.</p>
<p>I mixed the almond pulp with other nuts, added some water, rolled it flat and toasted the slab in the oven. Voila, bonus crackers.</p>
<p>This experience made me wonder: what other &ldquo;products&rdquo; am I buying that I don&rsquo;t need in &ldquo;product&rdquo; form? I buy mostly produce, yet I throw away so much packaging. We all do. Convenience is something I am (sometimes) willing to pay for, but lately I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;m looking for new products when shopping. Like a kid in a candy store. Something appealing that fits my lifestyle. Something that makes me feel happy. I pay 10xs more for a product, plus the energy wasted in manufacturing, because the words on the wrapper were enticing.</p>
<p>Cauliflower rice, for example, turned out to be cauliflower spun in a food processor. Add a couple eggs, some Parmesan, shape it into circles and you have new-fangled cauliflower <a href="https://www.outeraislegourmet.com/products/cauliflower-sandwich-thins">bread</a>. Add some oregano and you&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://www.outeraislegourmet.com/products/cauliflower-pizza-crust">pizza dough</a>.</p>
<p>Why do I love products and seek them out in a store full of actual food?</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I craved <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonliebigstuff/5766092612">Lik-M-Aid</a> fun dip, <a href="https://www.goodhumor.com/us/en/products/bars/strawberry-shortcake-dessert-bar.html">strawberry shortcake bars</a>, omg <a href="https://www.today.com/food/hostess-brings-back-classic-suzy-q-s-after-fans-complain-t123240">Suzy Qs</a> and in a pinch, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Savers-Butter-Candy-Single/dp/B000FELGJ0">butter rum life savers</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Ruth">Baby Ruths</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Grand_Bar">$100,000 Bars</a>. <a href="https://www.campbells.com/spaghettios/spaghettios-with-meatballs/">Spaghettios with little meatballs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice-A-Roni">Rice-a-Roni</a>, the San Francisco treat (made by PepsiCo.) I don&rsquo;t eat any of those things anymore but still feel nostalgic when I think of a Burger King chicken sandwich.</p>
<p>Food wasn&rsquo;t food, per se. Food was a product made by a brand. I didn&rsquo;t think of those items as products, as an artificial creation, like smoking a Marlboro. They were food that made me happy. Which is ironic, because I have celiac disease and other food allergies. Those products made me very ill, for decades. And consuming Coke and Big Macs are making many, many other people ill today.</p>
<p>Does driving to MacDonalds actually take less time than cooking a hamburger? If not, why do we think of it as &ldquo;fast&rdquo;?</p>
<p>More and more, I&rsquo;m discovering that what comes out of the earth is enough. We need sustainable farming. We need to feed the <a href="http://www.foodaidfoundation.org/world-hunger-statistics.html">billion undernourished people</a>. We probably don&rsquo;t need another breakfast cereal or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola_wars">cola war</a>. Do we?</p>

<p>When I look back on the last ten years, I can see where I’ve experienced enough. Where I haven’t. And how I can change so the next ten years are more than enough. Wanna try?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I retrospect regularly. Retrospectives are done during Agile software development, which is how I learned about them. They are exercises that create cohesiveness and self-governance in teams. They also create cohesiveness among my family. For example, we always retrospect on the way home from vacations.</p>
<p>Retros (as they are commonly called) have three customary questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What went well?</li>
<li>What went less well?</li>
<li>What actions can we take to improve the process going forward?</li>
</ol>
<p>This morning in my journal, I wrote a ten year retrospective. My intention was to focus on one year, 2019, put it behind me and kick off 2020. But 2020 is a nice round number, it enticed me to go deeper. Also, the 2010s were intense, career wise especially, and I am at a turning point. Now seemed a good time to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>The retro revealed insights I didn&rsquo;t anticipate, in areas I didn&rsquo;t expect. This post is not about those insights, specifically. (Maybe later!) The exercise did give me an idea though:</p>
<p>What would an &ldquo;enough&rdquo; retrospective look like? I came up with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the last [time period], I have experienced enough &hellip;? I have not experienced enough &hellip;? I have experienced too much &hellip;? I can improve my experience of enough by (taking these actions) &hellip;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided to do the exercise here, spontaneously. Live Retro! Risky! Gah! I worry I&rsquo;ll expose more than I want to expose. To you? To myself? Dunnoh. Here goes:</p>
<p>During the last ten years, I have experienced enough &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>love</li>
<li>career opportunities with meaningful clients doing interesting technology work</li>
<li>travel, beyond anything I ever anticipated (learn to code, see the world)</li>
<li>being known (enough) for what I do professionally</li>
</ul>
<p>During the last ten years, I have not experienced enough &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>writing</li>
<li>reading</li>
<li>true friendship sustained through the vicissitudes of our life (especially with other women)</li>
<li>time to recover from setbacks</li>
<li>exercise</li>
</ul>
<p>During the last ten years, I have experienced too much &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>betrayal and duplicity</li>
<li>uncertainty about who others really are and whether or not they are trustworthy</li>
<li>confusion about what to trust in myself (I&rsquo;m delusional sometimes too)</li>
<li>loss of things I treasured when I didn&rsquo;t submit to circumstances that were shitty for me</li>
</ul>
<p>During the next ten years, I can improve my experience of enough by &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>writing and reading and exercising first (prioritizing inner strength over outer control)</li>
<li>Walking in nature and being close to other people</li>
<li>Generally trusting myself a lot more and others a lot less</li>
</ul>
<p>The last needs some explanation. A hallmark of my 2010s was trusting people who turned out to be, well, really super awful and not trustworthy in ways that matter. People who gutted me. Sometimes other people, who I believed supported me, piled on or were distantly ambivalent. (Later, some saw the harm, especially after it happened to someone else, but by then, I didn&rsquo;t need their support anymore.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled to understand my role in those situations. Clearly, I have fallen down and my failures are my teachers. I am weak in, for example, staying committed to deeper work when drama stirs up and distracts. So I didn&rsquo;t set boundaries that others who are wiser would have set. I confess, sometimes I am the stirrer of the drama when deeper work scares me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also struggled to accept that I don&rsquo;t necessarily <em>have</em> a role in controlling or preventing those situations. If someone wants to hurt you, they usually can.</p>
<p>I relate to others primarily through empathy, which makes me vulnerable to and blindsided by people who draw on empathy but are not experiencers of empathy themselves. People who say and do the right things but are hiding their true selves. My openness attracts people but I do the lion&rsquo;s share of being open, which makes me even more vulnerable. I trust too soon and try to understand when I&rsquo;d be better letting go and moving on.</p>
<p>This relationship pattern began long before I learned to build the internet. It&rsquo;s not surprising that I choose the technology field, where the pattern flourishes. In tech, we talk openly about sexism and it exists. My personal view is that the pattern arises from a lack of relational maturity rather than gender. Men are also my biggest allies. More essentially, wisdom is not a leadership prerequisite. The lack of relational maturity and wisdom harms everyone (not just women).</p>
<p>Facebook. Nuff said.</p>
<p>My experience over the last ten years has been, by absolutely every measure, more than enough. Beyond my wildest ambitions. My heartbreak has been profound. In two cases, I worried that my wellbeing was unrecoverable. It wasn&rsquo;t. It never is. Trust that.</p>
<p>My one-year enough retro was gentler and rosier than my ten year list. An excellent trend. Going forward, my deepest commitment is &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love many. Trust Few. Always paddle your own canoe.</p>

<p>Seeking work life balance suggests we don’t work during the life part. We work all the time. Here is how I am blurring the edges.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>During our holiday staycation, my husband and I moved our comfortable cloud sofa and our television (which only streams) into our home office. I set up my crafting supplies and furnishings behind the sofa. We spent a week in that room. In the morning, I wrote, sometimes next to my husband listening to a soccer game through his headphones. We worked on client and business projects in the afternoons. In the evenings, we painted furniture, a movie playing in the background. We fell asleep to our favorites, <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Men in Black</em>, dogs piled on top of us, cats hissing at them to GTFO of their night space.</p>
<p>Our initial motivation wasn&rsquo;t to staycate in our office. It was noise. We work with remote teams. When we are focused on the same initiative, a shared space is ideal. When we aren&rsquo;t, and in 2020 we won&rsquo;t be as often, we are distracted by each other&rsquo;s meetings. Especially when one person&rsquo;s discussion is more interesting than whatever the other person is supposed to doing. (In retrospect, I honestly don&rsquo;t know how I got anything done in an office.)</p>
<p>My study is upstairs and it has a door. I write and do focused work there in the early morning. That room could also be a meeting room. If I were willing. I am not. No. No. A thousand times, no. I have learned the hard way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_of_One%27s_Own">Virgina Woolf</a> was right. Ignore her at our creative and intellectual peril.</p>
<p>Our home has very few rooms with doors, its mostly open. Our office is a room over the garage, separated by stairs from the main house but has no door. We could add a door. If you saw the work involved, you&rsquo;d agree, doing that is a last resort. So we moved Activities That Don&rsquo;t Need a Door into our office and moved my husband&rsquo;s desk out.</p>
<p>He called it &ldquo;moving the We stuff into one room.&rdquo; And so it was. The week was like vacationing on a small boat outfitted with all our favorite things. His desk went into a small room upstairs that has a door. We aren&rsquo;t sure what that room was supposed to be, it&rsquo;s tiny for a bedroom. A nursery maybe? We&rsquo;ve set it up three times now, a craft space, TV room, an office. My husband was a city dweller who never had space to consider a &ldquo;room of one&rsquo;s own&rdquo;, so he didn&rsquo;t think he wanted one. Now he&rsquo;s shopping at <a href="https://www.habitat.org/restores">Restore</a> for furnishings, settling in.</p>
<p>On Monday, we go &ldquo;back to work&rdquo;. But we aren&rsquo;t going back &hellip; we are going forward. Into a mindset I&rsquo;ve never experienced before. During the holiday, we did all kinds of work. Work for our clients, our business, this website. We painted our fireplace, restored furniture and painted picture frames with the help of our <a href="https://knottooshabbyny.com/">favorite mentor</a>. We cooked stews, made nut milk for the first time and grain-free crackers from the pulp. We trained the dogs to <a href="https://twitter.com/dianamontalion/status/1213225912986152963">jump through hoops</a> (literally). Oh, and, meanwhile there was Christmas and New Years.</p>
<p>We all spend our waking hours working on <em>something</em>. Yet, we don&rsquo;t call all work, work. The gaps between Job and Home; Paid work and Unpaid &ldquo;work&rdquo;; Creativity and Tasks are culturally-created distinctions. In those gaps grow a forest of &ldquo;I can never do enough or be enough&rdquo;. Maintaining our dissociated state is a painful way to live. We build internal walls and call them work life boundaries (mine leak constantly).</p>
<p>What if we see our daily investment of energy as a holistic group of meaningful activities that interdepend? Rather than a &ldquo;work hard, play hard&rdquo; dichotomy? What if we stopped dragging ourselves into Friday night and then dragging ourselves into Monday (or whatever your on/off structure is), and settled into a rhythm for the long run? One in which our work balances us. What if we valued <em>all</em> meaningful work we do, whether or not it is visible to or valued by others?</p>
<p>I want to measure &ldquo;enough&rdquo; by the quality of integration between the types of &ldquo;work&rdquo; I do. Rather than measure enough by the accolades and benefits I receive when I break myself into disparate personas. The roles I play do not describe the work I invest my energy in doing. What is my work?</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve asked these questions out loud, let&rsquo;s see what happens &hellip;</p>

<p>A writing exercise to uncover ‘enough of what?’ in which I share TMI and link to cool stuff.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We build our life by creating our experiences. We craft circumstances then acquire things we hope will make them comfortable and enjoyable. But we never quite settle into them, do we?</p>
<p>Picture, for example, peeling a potato. Does your vegetable peeler feel good in your hand or would you prefer a different one? Do you enjoy the activity or are you bored? What are you thinking about? What&rsquo;s happening in the background? (If you don&rsquo;t eat potatoes, or cook, substitute a different mental image.)</p>
<p>Each moment competes with infinite alternative experiences to crave, making us feel like we are never experiencing the right things. It&rsquo;s no wonder we struggle to know what is “enough”.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to limit this immense field of options. And, I would argue, neither does anyone else. We can seek outside expertise like minimalism or Kondo Joy Sparking. That&rsquo;s a good start but borrowing someone else&rsquo;s framework is not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>We can get woke, eschewing &ldquo;commercialism&rdquo; and advertising that dictates what we should buy, want, be, need, value, think and do. But we are semipermeable membranes. We will take in the world around us. And it will unsettle us.</p>
<p>Perhaps you hide behind uncertainty, believing you don’t know what you want so aren&rsquo;t really choosing? Hogwashbucket. Unless you are in a coma, you are always choosing. So you may as well own it. Alternatively, perhaps you do what I do and avoid uncertainty by shrinking experiences that suit you. Do them &ldquo;on the side&rdquo;. I feel confused when others disregard experiences I value. Am I deluded? Weird? Does this actually matter? My inner compass may point true north but I go west instead, pulled by other people’s gravity. Then lamenting that I never &ldquo;get time&rdquo; to experience what I value most.</p>
<p>Today, rather than asking &ldquo;what is enough&rdquo;, I explored “enough of what?” Here is the exercise I used. Maybe you grab a pen or open a writing app and try it? Before reading the rest of this post?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a bare room without furnishings or decoration. There is a window, a big closet and a bathroom. You will be spending the next three months here (by choice). What do you put in this room?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>********** pauses while you write ************</p>
<p>I put a comfortable mattress on a simple wooden frame in the corner. Then, cover the bed with soft thick <a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/119904?page=ultrasoft-comfort-flannel-sheet-set-stripe">sheets</a>, my <a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/shop-pillows/tempur-neck-pillow/v/572/">pillow</a>, a <a href="https://www.linenspa.com/pillows/linenspa-shredded-foam-reading-pillow">reading pillow</a> with a back rest, a fluffy <a href="https://www.brooklinen.com/products/down-comforter">down comforter</a> and a <a href="https://www.roughlinen.com/collections/linen-duvet-covers-collection">linen duvet cover</a>. Sherpa-lined slipper socks and a <a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/119051?catalog_id=TA&amp;csp=a&amp;attrValue_0=Dress%20Gordon">nightdress </a> go under the pillow and a <a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/90070?page=winter-fleece-robe-wrap-front">bathrobe</a> draped over the end, where a faux fur <a href="https://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod6250008&amp;categoryId=cat2850001">lap blanket</a> is folded. (Important note: it&rsquo;s currently winter.)</p>
<p>Next to the bed, I put a small, spindle-legged wooden nightstand with a clock or Alexa and a <a href="https://www.simplemodern.com/products/wave-water-bottle-25oz?variant=28247629856840">water bottle</a> on a coaster. I add my <a href="https://www.greenleafcentral.com/product/25mg-full-spectrum-dr-bobs-hemp-capsules/372">CBD capsules</a>, a <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/pilot-vanishing-point-fountain-pen-black-matte?variant=11884888817707">pen</a>, <a href="https://www.franklin-christoph.com/collections/paper/products/firma-flex-journal-notebooks">notebook</a> and <a href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/755236/Sharpie-Clear-View-Highlighters-Yellow-Pack/">highlighter</a>.</p>
<p>I put a thin bookshelf on the opposite wall and add a second water bottle, three of my <a href="https://www.mastgeneralstore.com/now-designs/good-morning-sunshine-diner-mug-130195">favorite</a> <a href="https://outofprint.com/products/library-card-yellow-mug">coffee</a> <a href="http://www.abchome.com/shop/ripple-mugs">mugs</a> and a basket for <a href="https://www.soma.com/store/">underwear</a> and <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/shop/womens-wool-socks">socks</a>. I stack a few <a href="https://www.macys.com/shop/product/hotel-collection-finest-elegance-bath-towel-collection-luxury-turkish-cotton-created-for-macys">towels</a>.</p>
<p>In the closet, I install a hook for my raincoat, down coat and sweater (layers!). There’s a walking stick with a small flashlight on a caribeener, <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/156043/merrell-moab-2-prime-mid-waterproof-hiking-boots-womens">hiking shoes</a> and a <a href="https://www.gregorypacks.com/packs-bags/day-packs/jade-28-1115JAD28.html?dwvar_1115JAD28_color=Ethereal%20Grey&amp;cgidmaster=jade#start=1">small backpack</a>. Hat, gloves, scarf, handkerchief and two pair of hiking socks go in a basket on the bookshelf. Stacked next to the basket are two sets of bottom layers, four pair of leggings (one fleece lined) and two supportive tops. (Note: anything from REI or LLBeans will work.)</p>
<p>On a small rod in the closet, I hang four comfortable dresses (frocks, really), two cardigans and a warmer cloak (aka blanket you wear). A pair of <a href="https://www.birkenstock.com/us/arizona-birko-flor-nubuck/arizona-core-birkoflornubuck-0-eva-u.html">Birkenstocks</a> is on the floor beneath. I realize this choice marks me as a Type of Person but honestly? They are super easy and comfortable shoes when worn with thick snuggly socks.</p>
<p>I unpack three more essentials from my “purple rolly cart” , a small Samsonite spinner I take on every trip:</p>
<ol>
<li>My <a href="https://www.strandbooks.com/merchandise-sale/folding-tote-amore-paris">journal bag</a>, current notebook journal and pen (see above), <a href="https://www.biddytarot.com/introducing-the-everyday-tarot-book-deck/">tarot cards</a>, a second <a href="https://www.cross.com/cr_en_us/4509-fd">fountain pen</a> in its case and a stash of replacement ink.</li>
<li>Four empty journals, three different-sized notebooks two more <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pen-violet-leopard?variant=11884884787243">fountain pens</a> with more ink, and my Kobo loaded with everything I currently have on my Kindle.</li>
<li>A laptop and my iPad with external keyboard. (Not my phone? Right now I am off for holiday vacation and, like most weekends, I don’t know where my phone is. Voicemails reach me via hangouts. I don’t call people, I Slack or email them.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I hang a giant whiteboard on the wall.</p>
<p>I feel ambivalent about whether or not to include “wifi”. I think: perhaps wifi for two to three hours a day? As soon as I type that, I feel anxious. Will I plan my whole day around the extraverted “distract me, save me from myself!” experiences that become available? Perhaps wifi but not in the room. (What would you do?)</p>
<p>Lastly, I move in a comfortable wooden desk, a reading chair with a foot rest and power cords for my three machines. I stack ten books on the shelf and will order ten more weekly, like groceries, trading out whichever I no longer want to keep. (Grubhub for books.?!)</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>I worry that I <em>should</em> add more. Will I be bored and feel impoverished and and &hellip; but you know what? That room sounds perfect to me. I don’t need any more. There are nice to haves I could add like a tea pot and some tea, bath supplies because of course there is a bathtub, duh. Perhaps a lamp with a warm-colored bulb in it, a deck of cards and a crafting project like needlework or knitting (neither of which I currently do.)</p>
<p>Confession: I cheated. I added a few things outside of my room. Undeveloped land to hike. A staffed kitchen serving meals of roasted vegetables, nuts, broths, healthy oils, some local meat. Nothing processed. Coffee arrives at 4:30 in a carafe, ready for when I wake up to journal. There&rsquo;s a big reading and writing room with oversized chairs, sconces and tapestries on the wall, a fireplace, and complex yet soothing music in the background for when I want to &ldquo;socialize&rdquo;. Imagine the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;pb=!1s0x89c259006ff852e3%3A0x62d6a1fcec2afc79!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMcLhErcopW2Ls94mUn5KMd7eUCiwiz37k2V-cH%3Dw480-h320-k-no!5sny%20rose%20reading%20room%20-%20Google%20Search!15sCAQ&amp;imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipMcLhErcopW2Ls94mUn5KMd7eUCiwiz37k2V-cH&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXs8Pg-efmAhUEZKwKHfWLA-IQoiowE3oECA0QBg">Rose Reading Room </a> got hygge. And there&rsquo;s a daily yoga class in a room with big windows, to guide me back into my physical body and release the stress of thinking.</p>
<p>********** end of exercise ************</p>
<p>Here, I pause. I don’t want to tell you this! I feel like I’m exposing myself waaaay too much. Everyone now knows what I most love. Worse, maybe you think less of me for not being vegan enough, for spending too much money on one thing or another, for not listing serious technology projects. What does it mean that I worry about those things? I don’t know; I just know that the imaginary room feels like “home”.</p>
<p>What did you put in your room? What do you feel when you read your list? Does some of it feel shameful, like “I shouldn’t have a tv in there!”? (Nothing we choose is bad (or good)).</p>
<p>Was there a point when you felt like you’d put enough in there?</p>

<p>My inner resistance to this practice is solidifying, concretizing. Simultanously, I am developing muscles I’ve never had and always needed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today is Day 8 and my inner resistance to sitting at my desk is solidifying, concretizing. Simultaneously, surprisingly, the rest of my day is deeper, with more productive joyful experiences. This change feels a tad miraculous, like drinking the antidote and discovering you&rsquo;d been poisoned for years.</p>
<p>Perhaps my antidote, constructing something meaningful to say, is unique to me. The specifics certainly are; most people probably don&rsquo;t need to write in a journal for an hour every morning but I lose my inner compass if I don&rsquo;t. Other people might not need to read every day to prevent a malaise I call soul flu. Others might not need to constantly categorize and strategically design new patterns of thinking or restructure complex systems but oh my, I definitely do. Workbooks were my second favorite toy as a kid. I am bored without challenges and when I&rsquo;m bored, I engage in self-destructive (for me) activities. Like binging on shallow social exchanges that leave me feeling superficially connected, a survival technique I learned in high school. You may not need the same specific combination of exercises but you probably need your practices as much as I need mine.</p>
<p>My resistance has always been with me. Each day, I&rsquo;d form it, like clay, into a list of things I must do. If I could get everything done -then- I could focus on more meaningful things. Done never arrived and it never will. When I did manage to move past my resistance, my fear other people&rsquo;s reactions to my abdication made me hyper vigilant, watching for trouble. There was always trouble. I was like a dysfunctional sea captain watching the ocean through binoculars from his house, dressed in sea captain garb, waiting for a ship to come in. Rather than sailing an actual boat.</p>
<p>This morning, I set my Focus@Will timer for 90 minutes (Alpha Chill today) and opened IA Writer. When I have the draft done, I will move the text into Atom. I have a geeky, versioned-controlled workflow that generates this static site. Sometimes I sprinkle on a bit of code to the site itself.</p>
<p>This process is working for me. And yet, like playing a video game, I encounter increasingly-strong challenges along the way. I thought &hellip; I really thought &hellip; these inner impediments, the monsters giving form to my resistance, were blockers. I felt shaky scared of them. Now, I see that (like in video games) these experiences are <em>strengtheners</em>.</p>
<p>Let me say this again, because it&rsquo;s a gigantic revelation for me. <em>Resistance is our strengthener</em>. Resistance arises where a muscle needs to grow. In my case, choosing wordsmithing before Taking Care of All The Things creates core strength. Resistance is where my bodymind needs some weight to push against.</p>
<p>This concept - resistance is a strengthener - is dangerous to generalize. How do we know the difference between healthy-for-us resistance and knowing something isn&rsquo;t good for us? Is it healthy resistance or are we forcing ourselves to do something we don&rsquo;t actually want to do?</p>
<p>I will carry those question with me into day 9, 10 &hellip; and report back my findings. I push myself to do all manner of things that in fact, I&rsquo;d be better off not doing. I believed efforting and overcoming were strength. Horseradish. That&rsquo;s Sysphus and nobody wants to be Sisyphus.</p>
<p>To help me discern between Sisyphus situations and experiences that grow my strength, I have developed five criteria. These are relatively new for me, I had to learn them all the hard way. Multiple times. Which gives me faith in their rightness, even if I still struggle to practice them consistently.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Are others hearing me?</em> I have invested many hours (months, years) repearing myself, trying to change other people&rsquo;s thinking, choices or behaviors. Saying the same thing again and again expected different responses is insanity. Don&rsquo;t go there. Change is a choice people make, not a thing you can gift them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Is there water in the well already?</em> When I discover a blindspot in a person or a situation, I usually encourage awareness to flow there. This is sometimes a worthwhile, loving effort. More often, it&rsquo;s like being thirsty, discovering a dry well, and rather than seek water elsewhere, start shoveling. There is no lack of water but there will never be a wellspring in a desert, my friends. Your garden needs the rain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Is developing expertise valuable in this situation?</em> I want to understand <em>everything</em> and everyone I encounter. Constant learning is joyful and I&rsquo;ve chosen a career that demands it. But true understanding requires time, energy and looking at things from many points of view. Is that work worthwhile? Sometimes. As Alanis Morrisette says, &ldquo;Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom.&rdquo; Relationships, with people and organizations, that have required developing specific-to-them knowledge have usually left me with little to show for my effort when the relationship ended. Now I&rsquo;m seeking balance and letting my inner compass quide me deeper my own expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Will others benefit from this effort?</em> As a woman, I was taught that selflessness, focus on others, is my natural state. All else is selfish or allowed &ldquo;me time&rdquo;. Horsewaddle. My work is valuable and requires my attention. But my work benefits no one if it&rsquo;s stuffed in a closet, where mine has literally been. Personal and professional development depends on hard work that has rarely been seen by others. But we aren&rsquo;t alone with our challenges. Others share them and ideally, we can help their journey be gentler.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This post has taken me four days to finish and lots of editing. At two points, this post was 3,000+ words long. I published it last night, thinking I was done. I wasn&rsquo;t. Words stockpiled themselves, demanding expression, damming the flow and making me feel stuck and overwhelmed. I chased many thought rabbits. My resistance made my body was heavy, bogged down. Emotionally, I felt unable to get out of my own way.</p>
<p>Now, it is New Year&rsquo;s Day. The day I intended to tell others about Year of Enough and invite them to read it. So I&rsquo;m deciding this post is &ldquo;done enough&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s time to head into the 2020 unknown. I hope we travel together.</p>

<p>In which I demonstrate my unrealistic relationship with TODO lists and wonder if, maybe, that relationship will change this year. Maybe.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; post. I <em>really</em> wanted to skip writing this morning, knowing I&rsquo;d probably write about this. I worry that too many enjoyable things to do is the very definition of &ldquo;first world problem.&rdquo; Granted, I like being productive and others tell me (constantly) that I am. Yet, I (constantly) believe that I&rsquo;m never doing enough.</p>
<p>I have a, let&rsquo;s go with &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo;, relationship with my todo lists. Perhaps others have similarly gotten lost on the path to &ldquo;enough&rdquo;. So we begin our journey with a glimpse into my likely-faulty-maybe mental models - my list of things to do today. Later, when I write finding balance, we&rsquo;ll have a &ldquo;before&rdquo; picture.</p>
<p>Maybe. When I typed &ldquo;balance&rdquo;, my body contracted. No way! I&rsquo;m keeping ALL THESE TODOS. (Is there a such thing as todo list hoarding?)</p>
<p>Okay, today on my &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list is (<em>deep breathe</em>):</p>

<li>Clean the litter box, ferret cage (wash bedding) and rat cage (they are new additions). Likely also includes paint the table the cage is on and build a rat play area (they climbed right out of the last one).</li>
<li>Clean / clear up the basement and create a space for doggos to hang out outside their crates</li>

<li>Read the stack of books we bought for our relaxing holiday!</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to erase this right now. Not because I&rsquo;m embarrassed to share these things. (I kinda am.) I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the fact that I was not being facetious when I said &ldquo;Today&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I know, of course, that I can&rsquo;t get all of these things done today. It&rsquo;s 9:19 am and I have been journaling / writing since 5:30 am so who has time?! And these are the priorities, other things will come up.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t know &hellip; unless I let myself really see that list &hellip; is that the items on that list are an unreasonable amount of mental and emotional weight to be carrying around. I honestly feel like I could and should and hope to get it all done.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: by the middle-end of January, I will have done them all, or at least most of them. For the first time in my life, I am asking myself &hellip; at what cost?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crazy-busy' is a great armor, it&rsquo;s a great way for numbing. What a lot of us do is that we stay so busy, and so out in front of our life, that the truth of how we&rsquo;re feeling and what we really need can&rsquo;t catch up with us. &ndash; Brene Brown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe Brene is onto something? Naw. Well, hmmm, maybe. What&rsquo;s the balance between joyful creatively productive and &hellip; that list?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Imagine the holidays with no sugar, including flour and alcohol. Horrifying thought or joyful ideal? I’ve never enjoyed food more.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Imagine the holidays with no sugar. Yes, I mean the white stuff or brown-colored white stuff. I also mean edible things your body interprets as sugar: grains (almost all flours), lactose (a glass of milk), super starchy vegetables like white potatoes, fake sweeteners (ewww) and alcohol (aka crack sugar). Imagine the holidays without those?</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t already living that reality, this thought might seem horrifying, if not improbable. Why would you want to do that?! I&rsquo;d pause now and explain my reasons for no longer eating sugar. But you know what? If your mind doesn&rsquo;t want to go there &hellip; and your mind probably does NOT want to go there &hellip; you&rsquo;ll argue with, rather than accept, those reasons. Push them away. And that&rsquo;s totally fine. I spent years experimenting. A good choice in one decade wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a good choice in another. Healthy eating is a process. There is <em>a lot</em> of gray area.</p>
<p>We can endlessly debate, for example, whether or not to eat maple syrup, honey, stevia, rice syrup. (A little, a little, perhaps, no.) Whether or not to include sweet potato. How much carb overall is &ldquo;right&rdquo;? I can share my science-informed choices and hard-earned strategies but I only really know what works for me. Meanwhile, you&rsquo;ll read this primarily to find out how I gave up sugar while still eating plenty of sweet food.</p>
<p>Spoiler: The story doesn&rsquo;t end that way. It does have a happy ending though. Unless &ldquo;happy&rdquo; means &ldquo;and then she ate all the Ferraro Rocher.&rdquo; Then no, it&rsquo;s not happy.</p>
<p>I was prepared to face this year&rsquo;s sugarless reality. I&rsquo;d had months of nourishment sans all those sugar things. I feel physically better than I&rsquo;ve ever felt. When I had &ldquo;a little bit&rdquo; at Thanksgiving, I felt like I&rsquo;d been hit by a flu bus. Which lessened my desire to re-experience that during my holiday downtime.</p>
<p>Yet, when the holiday downtime arrived, there was an undercurrent dampening my experience, a residue of &ldquo;wtf is joyful without sugar?&rdquo;. I especially miss my husband&rsquo;s hot toddies.</p>
<p>Almost twenty years ago, when I gave up gluten (which made me seriously ill for decades while I was misdiagnosed with other things and occasionally called a hyperchondriac), I replaced gluten treats with fake gluten sugar treats. I once ate an entire bag of gluten-free Oreos I found in a health food store because I hadn&rsquo;t had a cookie in years. Simultaneously consuming approx. 4,689 grams of sugar. Even with sugar, I was physically well beyond anything I could have anticipated &ndash; night and day &ndash; so it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to stay gluten free. I also needed to give up dairy and those two changes were all I could handle.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I react, with varying intensity, to all types of grains and sugars beyond a tad of maple syrup. I lost twenty pounds last year when I gave them up. In two weeks. Without eating fewer calories overall.</p>
<p>My hunch is that I&rsquo;ve always have reacted but my younger body could manage it because I starved myself a lot, out of habit and a bit of dysfunction. Then I married a man who cooks me delicious, appetizing real food. I&rsquo;ve learned to cook vegetables. Meanwhile, I discovered what my body can and can not tolerate on a daily basis.</p>
<p>My single-paragraph soap box (feel free to skip to the next!): Nobody actually <em>needs</em> cookies or a Mars bar or craft beer. We may want them; we are certainly trained to desire them. A century of storytelling linking &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; food with &ldquo;the good life&rdquo; have made bad food choices so ubiquitous, we can only imagine &ldquo;curbing&rdquo; our choices or &ldquo;limiting&rdquo; them. But our bodies are not made happy by a birthday cake &ndash; we are drugged by the birthday cake. There&rsquo;s a difference. We go to the doctor to treat our diet-related diseases but we will never be cured by a system that profits from the rise in them.</p>
<p>I know this post may seem radical and vigilante. Perhaps you think I&rsquo;ve lost my f&rsquo;n mind. If so, I&rsquo;ll whisper this in response &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gained my mind.&rdquo;  I have arrived in a mental space where I <em>crave</em> plants, especially fresh produce grown nearby. I add eggs or locally-raised meat (sometimes) and I am far more satisfied after eating than I ever was before. I eat three meals and I look forward to them. That was not true before.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you draw the line, my question is this: Rather than give up this food or that food, seeking moderation &hellip; what would it be like to simply eat food in its natural state? To buy, instead of manufactured food, ingredients?</p>
<p><img src="/images/ingredients.png" alt="Ingredients!"></p>
<p>Trust me when I say, the happy holiday ending is a surprise to me. In my 20s, I subsisted on nicotine, air, Smartfood and drama. I did cook for my son, avoiding sugar (and was told by a friend that it was child abuse not feed a one-year-old birthday cake and Happy Meals.) Unfortunately, I cooked us many foods containing gluten, so made myself sicker in the process. My heart, diving deeper into authentic food, was in the right place though.</p>
<p>Here are some foods I enjoyed over the holiday, including Christmas dinner. Over the next few days, I&rsquo;ll add links to recipes so you can enjoy them too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crispy brussel sprouts with pomegranate, walnut and cranberry pear balsamic</li>
<li>Pan-seared Filet mignon topped with fresh herb butter</li>
<li>Chocolate mousse parfait with strawberries, greek yogurt, pecans, walnuts and condimento drizzle</li>
<li>Beef stew thickened with butternut squash (Instant pot FTW)</li>
<li>Cauliflower-crust pizza with spinach, mushrooms and olive oil (meat optional)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.svorganic.com/">Farmer focus</a> chicken wings with buffalo sauce</li>
<li>Kale Caesar salad (we eat this almost every day)</li>
<li>Creamy blueberry and pecan quick dessert</li>

<p>Becoming free from the empty drama of “enough” at the holidays may require years of experimentation. But what matters most is knowing that your time, energy and attention are the most valuable things.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t celebrate the holidays. Or, rather, I didn&rsquo;t celebrate for many years. During the last two weeks of December, I rest and do nourishing things I enjoy, like reading all day wearing my pjs. The shallow, surfacey, hyper-desire-full, sugar-buzziness permeating this season has never felt joyful. It has felt stressful and expectation laden. As a kid, it was also dangerously drunken. I wondered why people approached December with any thought other than &ldquo;how will I hide my disappointment this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deciding to make the holidays a renewal time has been, well, renewing. Everyone else is occupied, so I enjoy a vacation without worrying about what&rsquo;s happening in my work life. Nothing is happening in my work life. When my now-husband and I became a couple, we relished that time together free from other people&rsquo;s expectations.</p>
<p>Four years ago, six days before Thanksgiving, we bought our home. We left a closet-sized apartment in Brooklyn and moved to  3000 sq ft on four acres in the Hudson Valley. We had lots of space and four pieces of furniture. All we cared about was making dinner in our adult-sized kitchen. We cooked our first Frank, a turkey raised by a local farmer. When my son arrived, he joined the First Annual Drive to Get Frank From the Farm. We selected our first holiday tree and bought some lights for it to brighten up the empty space.</p>
<p>The next year, there was Frank v2, a tree with more ornaments and less empty space. At Christmas, we exchanged presents. Why the change of heart? Honestly, I can&rsquo;t remember but that Christmas Day cured me of every &ldquo;will I be disappointed?&rdquo; fear I&rsquo;d carried. It was joyful. And enough. We agreed that we didn&rsquo;t need to repeat the expense every year. Like coming home from a great vacation but not intending to return.</p>
<p>Good thing, because the next year, we were both laid off and started a new business. Scarey! The holiday was still wonderful. At Thanksgiving, there was Frank v3. Over the holiday break, we cooked a panoply of meals we loved, like wandering back through time and collecting the dishes that made you happy. Kitchen time was as satisfying as unwrapping presents had been the year before.</p>
<p>We also started Jolly Book Flood. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/iceland-jolabokaflod-christmas-book-flood">Icelandic &ldquo;Jolabokaflod&rdquo;</a>, we visited a <a href="https://goldennotebook.indielite.org/">local bookstore</a>, bought ourselves a small stack of books and spent much of the holiday reading in front of the fireplace. Jolly Book Flood is the best tradition I&rsquo;ve ever experienced; I wish I&rsquo;d thought of it years ago.</p>
<p>This Thanksgiving, amidst the Picking Up Frank v4 at the New Farm Because the Previous Frank Farm Isn&rsquo;t Raising Turkeys Anymore (bonus: they also had fresh veggies and butter), I announced that I wanted a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Christmas. With presents and stockings. What, on earth, got into me? I&rsquo;m not sure but I think it was Hope. Hope, like celebrating a bountiful harvest also instills faith that there will be more. My business stabilized with opportunities on the horizon, though I still feel constantly insecure. We&rsquo;ve had enjoyable client work and my husband starts a longer-term position in January. We were celebrating the end of a hard year that was mostly hard <em>because we were afraid it was going to be hard</em>. The year was actually fine. We wanted to create something that reinforced that sense of &ldquo;its okay&rdquo; together. Something that reinforced our growing sense of we have and are doing &ldquo;enough&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Which is &hellip; kinda maybe &hellip; ironic? Wouldn&rsquo;t celebrating &ldquo;enough&rdquo; have been not buying anything at all?</p>
<p>Perhaps, but I&rsquo;m a big fan of irony. I didn&rsquo;t experience grasping or fear or lack or heavy expectation during the entire process. We invented the process. Perhaps, next year when I need cash that could have been in our savings account, I will change my mind. Perhaps. Or perhaps, by celebrating, we have energized ourselves for another year of solving the challenges that will arise. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Right now, here we are, having enjoyed expressing ourselves together. We had four criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Buy locally</em>: The experience included lovely afternoons browsing in nearby towns like New Paltz and Rhinebeck. We visited local retailers that sustain us, like our <a href="http://www.scarboroughfarenp.com/">Balsamic vinegar shop</a> and <a href="https://pegasusshoes.com/">favorite shoe store</a> and groceries at <a href="https://adamsfarms.com/">Adams</a>. When we didn&rsquo;t buy locally, we supported only companies we want to support. (Which, I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t be surprised to hear, did not include Amazon.)</li>
<li><em>Establish a stocking tradition</em>: Stockings are complicated, it turns out. My husband is British, raised in Spain, so he had strange ideas like wrapping the in-stocking gifts. We talked things through, which was fun. What food: oranges, nuts? The funnest part (yes, its a real word, a regular superlative of the adjective fun) was stockings for our pets. I suspect stockings will stay even if presents don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li><em>Buy presents for ourselves</em>: The surprising show stopper was buying presents for ourselves and wrapping them. I <em>loved</em> seeing what he choose for himself, as much as I enjoyed what he choose for me. If I could wave a magic wand, I would transform the holidays into this self-and-other-satisfying experience. I gave myself meaningful things that encourage self care as well as enjoyed surprises. I rarely enjoy surprises, for those like me, it mitigates that risky social experience.</li>
<li><em>Jolly Book Flood 4Evah</em>: We expanded the tradition, visiting <a href="https://oblongbooks.com">Oblong</a>, <a href="merrittbooks.com">Merrit</a> and <a href="https://strandbooks.com">The Strand</a>. We also replaced our Kindle with a Kobo. More on that in another post.</li>
</ol>
<p>What have I learned about &lsquo;enough&rsquo; at Christmas? Nothing concrete. I have no 5 step plan for minimalism or One Rule to Rule All Rules. Each year, &lsquo;enough&rsquo; &hellip; depends. On many things.</p>
<p>The only constant truth, underlying every year when I was free from the empty drama of &ldquo;enough&rdquo; at the holidays, is this: <em>your time, energy and attention is the most valuable part</em>. Honor the crafting of a loving, nourishing experience, whatever that might be, alone or with others you choose. (Especially if you celebrate as a spiritual experience or don&rsquo;t celebrate because it isn&rsquo;t your spiritual experience.) Eschew cultural marketing. There is nothing to chase at the holidays. Let joy find you.</p>

<p>Who gets ‘a thousand invitations’? How many invitations are enough? What are you doing New Year’s eve?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIcuK7wW8bU">What are you doing New Year&rsquo;s Eve</a> is playing constantly. I always wonder, &ldquo;who gets a thousand invitations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many are &ldquo;enough&rdquo; invitations? For me, at the moment, none. None are enough. Admitting this has been a long, sloggy-yet-steady climb towards not socializing in situations that I don&rsquo;t enjoy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t enjoy parties where everyone is drinking, especially after a few hours of drinking. Cocktail dresses are a beauty contest I don&rsquo;t enjoy unless I <em>want</em> to gussy up for someone. Someone, not public consumption. Even when I feel pretty, its fraught with anxious monitoring of male attention. I don&rsquo;t enjoy small talk or being judged by my hairstyle. I like hairstyles! (My hair is currently three shades of purple and orange, it looks fabulous and weirdly natural.) I don&rsquo;t enjoy pretending to be happy together when only two or three of us are actually happy. It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>
<p>The more I understand about enough, the more I trust relationships built by engaging with other people&rsquo;s thinking, over time. Understanding others as they understand themselves. You don&rsquo;t get that opportunity at most parties. Satisfying social experiences are reading, writing, deep conversation, mutual problem solving. I love mutual problem solving so much, I&rsquo;ve made it my profession.</p>
<p>The nourishment and intimacy I need from others is the kind that fills me with ease, strengthens the soundness of my reasoning and encourages faith in my experiences. It makes me feel good because it is, deeply, good. When I socialize well, I love myself more after sharing time with others. Rather than leave feeling like I&rsquo;m not young enough or thin enough or smart enough about life or I talk too much or &hellip; whatever.</p>
<p>Not everyone experiences social time the way I do. Some of you are true extroverts and more power to you! I adore watching people who are energized by interaction interact. Its art. I am extremely outgoing, I enjoy the theater of society sometimes. And - it exhausts me. I prefer a book, a fireplace and discovering who you really are, until I can feel your presence.</p>
<p>Second only to conversation with a close friend, yoga classes and focused retreats are my preferred social situations. By far. After September 11th, I spent New Years on a 10 day mediation retreat <a href="https://www.dharma.org/retreats/535">like this one</a>. Everyone was working on their shit together. Some were in the towers when they were hit; we sat with everything we were experiencing. Our teachers gently guided us into our stuck spaces and our anger. Sprinkled throughout, there was laughter and some ease. Retreats, solitary road trips, hikes alone or with my husband and a few incredible spa experiences are, by far, my most memorable and meaningful celebrations.</p>
<p>I know alone together time doesn&rsquo;t satisfy every social need I have. I also love engaging with people. Understanding &lsquo;enough&rsquo; is recognizing that <em>my hours are not unlimited</em>. Prioritizing my reasons for socializing (aka leaving the house), I discover that I like working with others more than partying with them. I&rsquo;ve decided that&rsquo;s enough for now.</p>
<p>What am I doing New Years? Sleeping when I get tired. But with a festive feeling of special celebration, perhaps a kiss at midnight if I&rsquo;m still awake. The beauty of the holidays is the quiet, amazingly-enjoyable down time I luxuriate in while everyone else is busy partying.</p>

<p>In the center of my inner world, there is a garden. I have arrived here. Just in time for the holidays.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the center of my inner world, there is a garden. I have arrived here. I am speaking metaphorically of course, but metaphor is real too. When a change manifests in our lives, it often began as a subconscious reshaping of a story. We reconstruct our inner world to accommodate a new view. We make space. With practice, we are able to envision that space as easily as remembering a pleasant day at the beach.</p>
<p>When I found my inner garden, I erupted inside. Like a water fountain long covered up. There is much I&rsquo;ve longed to say, suppressed by what I&rsquo;m supposed to be saying, thinking, doing, feeling.</p>
<p>The gate was locked. I opened it with a rusty key that&rsquo;s hung around my neck since childhood. The key that previously, easily unlocked my creative connection to everything. Until I learned that failure to obey (mostly male) demands for my time, energy and attention caused more suffering than I could endure (then).</p>
<p>My garden is brown, overgrown with unfriendly weeds. The sky is gray and the soil is dry. There are no birds. Isolated from daily tending, denied the careful loving attention of my creativity, intelligence and self-awareness, my garden has withered. I was elsewhere, trusting the world to give back nourishment eventually, if I did right things. It didn&rsquo;t. The world doesn&rsquo;t. Our garden is ours to tend.</p>
<p>Despite the current quiet emptiness, my inner garden whispers of extraordinariness. I sense the awesomeness of power available within.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Perhaps we all have an inner space where we <em>know</em> our original connection to a lush sustaining world. Where our thoughts are nourished not by advertising but by sun, plants, the interplay of ecosystems and weather patterns. Where our daily work is surrounded by the moving sounds of rain and growing self awareness. In our garden, we are complete, blessed by abundance. Right sized.</p>
<p>This metaphor is fraught, yes? I write this post on the 22nd of December, amidst our annual resurrection of Eve&rsquo;s mythic original sin, Mary&rsquo;s disembodied virtue and subtextually, the vanquishing of demon Lilith who doesn&rsquo;t obey Men who are God. Hallelujah.</p>
<p>There is a tree decorated in my home. I didn&rsquo;t know until recently that the Christmas tree is connected to the Eden tree which, according to some, originated on Adam and Eve day, December 24th. The story of how we, especially women, don&rsquo;t deserve our place in the garden.</p>
<p>Perhaps we simply forget this space, while lost in the world. We have certainly erased an essential element needed to thrive in it. Goddess. Where is she in our stories? She is always, also, a source of our strength. Our balance. Resurrecting our awareness of metaphorical divine feminine is, I think, key to coming home. Rebalancing and revitalizing our understanding of the world that sustains us.</p>
<p>It is not a man&rsquo;s world unless we believe it is.</p>
<p>Today, I begin carefully re-cultivating my inner garden. I begin with the most essential vow: to arrive. Then: to stay. To rest and think here, to drink the fresh water of good ideas. To trust that I am allowed, fully and completely, to own and craft my experiences.</p>
<p>Here, I am enough. Here, there is enough. I am free to work, deeply connected. I am free to become a work of art.</p>

<p>Today begins a Year of Enough. On this Winter Solstice, I devote myself to exploring Enough. Being enough, doing enough, having enough. And publishing consistently about the experience.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Where this work leads is uncertain. The value is clear. I have always believed that I am not enough. I never feel like I do enough. (I do a lot). I struggle to enjoy my daily life because I am busy trying to create an enjoyable daily life. Its a mindless, endless ouroboros. I&rsquo;m not alone. As a matter of fact, I don&rsquo;t personally know anyone who isn&rsquo;t chasing their tail in this way.</p>
<p>I  choose to stop. To explore what it means to &ldquo;arrive&rdquo;. I have enough. Oddly, I feel ashamed to admit this: I have arrived in the life I hoped to create. I own much of my time, energy and attention. I am not necessarily &ldquo;financially secure&rdquo; but I am not drowning in &hellip; anything. I can breathe.</p>
<p>Yet, I hold my breath, afraid that nothing will continue to be enough. I strive. I search for the next thing I need. If I don&rsquo;t settle in, enjoy this day and my work and this space I&rsquo;ve created, I fear I will die before <em>ever</em> feeling satisfied.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I want to be absolutely clear about one thing:</p>
<p><em>You can&rsquo;t fake this.</em> I am publishing a Year of Enough because at the moment, I have enough. I&rsquo;ve worked very hard to arrive here. But many people work very hard and are struggling against forces they can not control. When I was poor, there was never &ldquo;enough&rdquo;. When I was in abusive situations, there <em>was not enough safety</em>. Changing my <em>own</em> mindset in some situations would be denial and dumb (at best).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measure your success by what you had to give up to get it. &ndash; Dalai Llama</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when there is enough, landing in the middle of our messy mind and conditioned experience is painful. We&rsquo;ll talk about that pain. There is a space inside we can occupy, where we craft our best life. Where we come home. But that journey requires more letting go, more painful self awareness, more seemingly &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; work than we&rsquo;re probably signed up to do. This isn&rsquo;t a three-steps-to-happiness program. This is facing every demon you are running from while chasing enough.</p>
<p>Our demons are ingrained in our mind and body and when we change, they hurt us. We don&rsquo;t want to hurt them back; we love them. They give us a false sense of security with their promises. &lsquo;Cause we all just wanna be big rock stars and live in hilltop houses. I live in a hilltop house, surrounded by four acres. I love my house. And it&rsquo;s so much work. Most days, I feel crushed by all I don&rsquo;t do. I fear I will lose the house if I don&rsquo;t have money. So I work harder in my career, which means less time for housework. Then I feel crushed by both. I imagine I&rsquo;m working towards a lovely, self-sufficient homestead. But you know what? That&rsquo;ll just be more daily work.</p>
<h3 id="everything-is-work">Everything is work</h3>
<p>A Year of Enough is one thing above all else: transferring more time, energy and attention into meaningful, valuable work. Redefining what we mean by &ldquo;work&rdquo;. Stop chasing more of whatever we don&rsquo;t need and come home to what we do.</p>
<p>What about ambition?! Bettering yourself! Oh yes, I&rsquo;ve done so much of that. In my 30s, someone said to me &ldquo;you know, the bookstore has other sections beside self help.&rdquo; I believed I was broken. I <em>was</em> broken. But if you glue the handle back on your teapot, satisfied you fixed it, then never make tea &hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered this: When you settle into enough, you get more done. This is a nascent experience for me, one I&rsquo;m committed to exploring. I already see that I make better choices when I feel enough. Not enough makes me constantly feel like I&rsquo;ve chosen the wrong things or not enough of the right things. When I choose, the next step is to choose more. Choose again. Choose choose choosechoosechoose. We don&rsquo;t need to hoard so many choices.</p>
<p>Some choices are essential though. Four foundational choices sustain my daily practice:</p>
<h3 id="eat-real-food">Eat real food</h3>
<p>Food choices are a microcosm of all our other choices. I choose real food primarily grown by my neighbors. This change, away from marketed food, has taken decades. I eat very few manufactured products. Without paying attention to what we eat, I think finding &ldquo;enough&rdquo; is incredibly difficult. Especially for those relying on some type of drug to sustain them. (Sugar is a drug.) If you haven&rsquo;t explored quality nourishment, that practice is a good place to begin.</p>
<h3 id="daily-self-awareness-practice">Daily self awareness practice</h3>
<p>I write in a journal every morning for an hour. This mind-relationship practice has become sacred to me. I rarely miss and if I do, it&rsquo;s for a reason I don&rsquo;t regret. My practice began with twenty mins of writing while drinking coffee, tracking the consecutive days in the top right-hand corner of the page. Then I increased to thirty minutes. Then, after a year of wishing I could write longer, I realized I <em>could just write longer</em>.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a daily for-you practice, creating one is another a good place to begin. I think it can be many things: yoga, painting, reading, walking, gardening, knitting, chopping wood, meditation. Anything that invites you to become aware of your own mind.</p>
<h3 id="give-up-on-doing-enough">Give up on doing enough</h3>
<p>I have been a writer and reader all of my life. This central truth has been buried under a monumental pile of Everything Else That Must Get Done First OMG.</p>
<p>You know what? I failed. I failed to get it all done, despite <em>decades</em> of sustained effort. I move everything that falls down on top of me, meet expectations and demands on my time, energy and attention. The next day, they fall back down on me. I have raised a child, built a career in a challenging profession, learned more about relationships than anyone should ever need to know. I have gotten free from harm only to end up back in harms way.</p>
<p><em>You never, ever arrive at enough by pushing more rocks up more hills.</em> Thinking maybe tomorrow you&rsquo;ll have more time. You won&rsquo;t. And you are probably, partly, to blame. When you put yourself in the center of your life &hellip; you&rsquo;ll discover the pain you are avoiding by staying busy elsewhere. There is no easy path. Only harder paths with greater rewards.</p>
<h3 id="do-enough-for-you">Do enough for you</h3>
<p>This year, I don&rsquo;t know what will happen. (<em>whispers</em> I am terrified and fear I will die.) I feel safer when taking care of everything and everyone else, striving, seeking, hoping, efforting to be enough, have enough, do enough of the right things. I have chosen relationships and situations that gave back so little compared to what they took. And in the end, blamed me for not satisfying.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be me. The hamster wheel is exhausting. Don&rsquo;t pour yourself into other people hoping your effort will enable and empower them. Enable and empower yourself. Here&rsquo;s the nonintuitive truth: You enable and empower others when you are authentic and caring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom. &ndash; Alannis Morrisette</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t in a situation that nourishes you, perhaps it won&rsquo;t grow, no matter how much harder you try. Accept and allow others to be as they are. Let them own it. Create your own path forward.</p>
<h4 id="this-is-stupidly-hard-for-many">This is stupidly hard for many</h4>
<p>If you are a woman, you know others will rarely &ldquo;own it&rdquo; when you speak truth and create your own path. If you are gay or black or an immigrant &hellip; &ldquo;let them own it&rdquo; might mean no economic security or legal rights or even surviving an encounter with &ldquo;authority&rdquo;. I do not, in any way, minimize that struggle. I still face it myself sometimes.</p>
<p>Please, do not mistake me. This is no fluffy kumbaya journey of ease and safety. Sometimes, enough is taken from us and we are crushed by systemic power or cruelty. I&rsquo;ve made some excruciating choices. This year is not a Disney ride. It&rsquo;s a moon landing. Perhaps you are ready. If so, I&rsquo;m glad we are going together.</p>
<h2 id="beginning">Beginning</h2>
<p>There is much more to do on this website. I&rsquo;m not done! Yet, here I go, pressing publish.</p>
<p>And so it begins.</p>

<p>In two days, I leave on a month-long, drag-an-RV-behind-the-truck road trip. What - the frack - am I doing?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today, I am packing easy-care outdoor clothes, precooking stews, cleaning the house and bathing the ferret. In two days, I leave on a month long, drag-an-RV-behind-the-truck road trip with my husband and two dogs (14 and 7 months old). Current status: What.thefrack.am.I.doing?</p>
<p>I started writing a fluffy-pancakes (with recipes!) helpful, breezy post as entrée into the world of adventure travel blogging. Writing teachers say focus on the ‘you’ voice, write for your audience. Not the “I” voice. Alas,  <em>I</em>  don’t know what  <em>you</em>  need. (Hey, what’s up?)</p>
<p>The truth is, this trip is deeply and profoundly about me. About my need to re-member who I am and what I most value. And about us. Our need to re-connect away from the job and household chores (though we love those too). We leave on our anniversary and in the three years since we married and bought a home,  <em>I</em>  has become  <em>we</em>.  <em>We</em>  snuck up on me, having been the I-am-woman-hear-me-go-on-road-trips-by-myself person. I rarely expected emotional intimacy and now, I am suffuse with it, deeply and daily reveling in the  <em>we</em>  space. I want to go deeper.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’m tired. Like so many of you (!), I often subsume my deepest, most valuable strengths to “serve” other peoples' vision and priorities. Even though, ironically, my role is to strategically craft vision and priorities. As a woman, I’ve ingested “second class” intellectually and invested in agendas that don’t give back as much as they take. Trusting my own leadership has been hard won. Recently, I committed myself to crafting and following my own vision and priorities. The metaphor of “road trip” — mapping a journey I collaboratively own — seems right. I trust metaphor.</p>
<p>In typical fashion, I am all the frack over this road trip thing. There are three prioritized Trello task lists, multi-level gear spreadsheets, a stack of containers that fit in the RV with maps for what goes in them. I’ve never owned an RV and we still don’t know how to back it up correctly (gasp!). Yet, I’ll eat my hat if it’s not well outfitted. Decades of backpacking taught me that skill but also, mostly, I architect everything.</p>
<p>Everything. All the time. Architecture is crafting a structure in which valuable experiences can happen. I architect technology so my materials are systems, applications, code and engineering teams but the underlying purpose is the same. We have created a flexible structure including a comfortable foam mattress, Corelle dishes, freshly-washed dog beds, paper maps and a sewer hose we don’t know how to use yet. We have reservations and we left days unplanned so we can structure as we go. (aka Agile) We are almost ready …… for the difficult part. Enjoying the trip.</p>
<p>I know, you just thought “What?! Huh?!” Enjoying requires letting go. Settling in, rolling with the journey as it unfolds. Releasing my constant deciding, structuring, planning and just … be. I am … okay, I suck at that. My mind makes noise. I need quiet.</p>
<p>The rhythm will help quiet my mind: focused work every morning, packing up and heading to the next destination, cooking dinner in the evenings, hiking with the dogs, reading by the fire. Rest. Renewal. Heavenly in theory. In practice, well, we’ll see. Stay with me.</p>

<p>“Wake up” is a marvelous goal for a roadtrip! Both the surface meaning “enjoy each morning on the road, even when you’re exhausted” and the deeper meaning “seeing yourself all-too clearly is true freedom.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Initially, this post was a cleverly-titled (see previous) exploration of the first two, exhausting, road trip days. This morning (day three) I was dragged from dreamland at 6:15am by the 7-mos-old puppy barking to go out. Both puppies (is 15 months old still a puppy?) sleep freely in the main space; we sleep behind a closed bedroom door.</p>
<p>Without incident is a miracle. At home, the walls are chewed. If you are cringing at the time, yesterday he woke us up at 5:15, so today we felt gifted with extra sleep.</p>
<p>Instead, this post became a lesson in “be careful what you wish for”. The title has been percolating in my subconscious for two days. While writing in my morning journal (a daily habit, one hour plus coffee), I discovered that “wake up” means “uncover and examine difficult and often shame-inducing, long-standing issues and delusion that are blocking me from going deeper.”</p>
<p>Fuck you, magic title therapy.</p>
<p>The specifics of my inner explorations, the ones pushing their way into the light for weeding, might come out in my publishing. Probably not. My journey is about letting go of shame, fear, harmful patterns of consciousness and my demon secret strategies for staying trapped in Seemed Like Really Good Ideas at the Time. I will likely do that dark work in private. We’ll see.</p>
<p>In public, I will share the fruits of this labor. Today’s fruit: “wake up” is a marvelous goal for a roadtrip! Both the surface meaning “enjoy each morning on the road, even when you’re exhausted” and the deeper meaning “seeing yourself all-too clearly is true freedom.”</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, now that I&rsquo;m up, the dogs have gone back to sleep.</p>
